Your summer will be devoted entirely to research. Many MLT grads continue on to Ph.D. programs at CMU and other top institutions, while others pursue careers at companies emphasizing research and rapid innovation.|LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook Page 26 4.1.7 Transferring Into the Ph.D. Program The LTI does not allow direct transfers from its master\u2019s programs into its Ph.D. program . The student must apply for the Ph.D. at the usual time . However, students that are already enrolled in an LTI degree program are not required to retake GRE and TOEFL exams or to produce new transcripts from other universities. 4.1.8 Transferring Out of the Ph.D. Program The Ph.D. program doe s not prevent students from transferring to another degree program . A student who is interested in transferring out of the Ph.D. degree program should consult the handbook and Program Director of the desired degree program to learn whether transfers are permitted, and if so, how, and when to request such a transfer. 4.2 LTI Academic Policies 4.2.1 \u201cGrandfather\u201d Policy A student can graduate under the policies in effect at the time that the student entered the program; or, at the student's choice, the student can graduate under policies that are adopted after the student entered the program. If it is not realistic to follow a particular policy exactly, the department may approximate the policy as closely as possible; this situation is rare and typically arises only when a student is enrolled in the program for an extended period of time. 4.2.2 Definition of Transfer Credit vs. Course Exemption The LT I may grant transfer credit or issue an exemption for equivalent graduate courses previously completed at another institution. This decision rests with the director of the particular program. If a student is exempt from a required course due to prior cour ses or experience, the student can replace that course with an open elective. The student does not receive credit for the external course but can take any course that could normally count toward the degree in its place. If a student receives credit for pr ior coursework completed at CMU or elsewhere, the student receives that many units of credit, and the total amount of required coursework is reduced by that amount. 4.2.3 External Employment/Consulting Students funded by LTI research projects are expected to wor k primarily for those projects. Since consulting provides useful experience, students are generally permitted to consult at most one day per seven-day week, with the advisor's consent . International students must also have approval in advance from the Office of International Education (OIE) ; otherwise, they may be in violation of their visa status. See also External Internships",
