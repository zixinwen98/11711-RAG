Students are expected to attend the LTI's Orientation (\u201cImmigration Course ,\u201d or IC) lectures, in which faculty describe their interests and areas of expertise, and to be proactive about meeting individually with potential advisors. After meeting with several potential advisors, each student will be asked to indicate a firs t, second, and third choice for advisor. Meanwhile, the potential advisors determine how many new students they can take, and indicate their preferences. Finally, the entire LTI faculty meets as a \u201c Marriage Committee \u201d to determine the best set of matches. Some entering MLT students are prefunded, meaning they have received and accepted a funding letter from a faculty member before the Marriage Process. (Even students who are prefunded must attend the research talks, to become acquainted with the LTI\u2019s rese arch projects.) Even self-supporting MLT students are expected to perform research with a faculty advisor, since research experience is an important part of our graduate programs. Until a student finds a specific advisor, the chair of the LTI graduate prog rams serves as the advisor. How to change advisors: The initial advisor selection should be made carefully. However, it is possible to change advisors. To do so, the student should find another faculty member willing to serve as an advisor, and then make a request to the Program Director to switch advisors. The LTI follows the long-standing SCS policy that both the new and old advisors need to agree to the change; typically, this is not a problem ( assuming the new advisor has agreed in advance, as described here ). It is to the student's advantage to avoid switching advisors, especially late in their graduate studies, because forging a strong student-advisor relationship takes time. 4.3 Optional Masters\u2019 Thesis MLT students may optionally elect to complete a Mast ers\u2019 Thesis; it is not required. Students who intend to apply for the PhD program should consider the MLT Thesis as one of several ways to demonstrate their research potential. Other possibilities include innovative research in a research project or class project work. The MLT Thesis must be completed according to the following guidelines. Note in particular the October 31 proposal deadline! \u2022 There are two course components required for students who elect to complete the M.S. Thesis: 11-928 \u2013 Masters \u2019 Thesis I (with the chosen thesis advisor, typically for 12 units, typically in the Fall of their second year) and 11-929 \u2013 Masters \u2019 Thesis II in the following Spring. \u2022 Each of these two courses counts towards 6 units of MLT-level LTI course credit; if the student goes on to an LTI PhD, the second course (11-929) counts towards one PhD lab requirement. \u2022 The MLT thesis may focus on either a significant research result or a significant implementation of a new technology. The student should work with their adv isor to define an interesting but bounded thesis research project. The MLT thesis culminates in",

        "retrieved_doc": "MIIS Graduate Student Handbook Page 14 A MIIS student must complete the following curricular requirements: 1. Qualifying courses: MIIS-16 students must pass 72 units (typically 6 12-unit courses) and MIIS-21 students must complete 96 units (typically 8 12-unit courses) in qualifying master\u2019s courses. A qualifying master\u2019s course is defined as: a. Any graduate course (600-level or higher) offered by the Language Technologies Institute; and b. Any graduate course (600-level or higher) from the list of approved qualifying courses (Section 3. 2.4). 2. Free elective: Students must pass 12 units (typically 1 course) in elective master\u2019s course(s). A free elective is defined as: a. A graduate course (600-level or higher) with content relevant to the MIIS program objectives offered by the School of Computer Science ; and b. A course approved by the student's advisor and the degree Program Director. c. A student may not use the same course to satisfy both a qualifying course requirement and an elective course requirement. 3. Breadth requirements : Students must demonstrate breadth by passing one course in each of the following areas. In addition, MIIS-21 students must take two more LTI courses (24 units total) in one of the following areas of concentration: \u2022 Human language; \u2022 Machine learning; and \u2022 Language technology applications. The department maintains and publishes a list of courses that satisfy each of these requirements (Sections 3. 2.5 \u2013 3.2.7). Some c ourses used to satisfy a breadth requirement can also satisfy qualifying course requirements. A student should get approval from the director for the breadth courses , if not listed below. 4.4 Approved Qualifying Courses Any graduate course (600-level or higher) offered by the Language Technologies Institute is a qualifying course. Any two graduate courses (600-level or higher) offered by departments within the SCS relevant to the MIIS degree other than LTI (Machine Learning or Computer Science departments, etc.) may be counted as approved qualifying courses |MIIS Graduate Student Handbook Page 13 4 MIIS Degree Requirements and Related Policies/Protocols 4.1 Program Options The MIIS degree is offered in two options: Option 1. Standard MIIS degree (MIIS-16)-A 16-month track that is completed in three academic semesters (fall, spring, fall) and a summer internship. Option 2. MIIS: Advanced Study degree (MIIS-21)-A 21-month track that is completed in four academic semesters (fall, spring, fall, spring) and a summer internship. MIIS: Advanced Study track offers in depth degree in one of the following areas of concentration: \u2022 Human Language for Language Technologies \u2022 Language Technology Application \u2022 Machine Learning for Language Technologies Part-time options are available in some cases. 4.2 Required Units for Degree Attainment To complete the Master of Science in Intelligent Information Systems, a student must satisfy three types of requirements. Curricular requirements ensure that MIIS students receive instruction in core intelligent information systems technologies while also allowing an opportunity to specialize in areas of personal interest. Practice requirements are opportunities to apply and hone new skills while building state-of-the-art systems. Grade requirements ensure that students have demonstrated a certain level of sk ill while completing degree requirements. All three types of requirements are described below. MIIS-16 students must take at least 84 units (typically 7 12-unit courses) of qualifying and elective courses that satisfy human language, machine learning, and language technology applications breadth requirements and 66 practice units for a total of 150 units to attain the Standard MIIS degree. MIIS-21 students must take at least 108 units (typically 9 12-unit courses) of qualifying and elective courses and 66 practice units to satisfy their degree requirements, making it a total of 174 units to attain the MIIS: Advanced Study degree. 4.3 Core Requirements|Master of Science in Intelligent Information Systems (MIIS) Requirements: The Intelligent Information Systems degree offers students the flexibility to create their own course of study in consultation with their advisor. MIIS students gain three types of practical experience: software development supervised by their advisor (24 units equivalent to two courses); a summer internship (which can be waived for students that have sufficient prior professional experience); and a capstone project executed in a group of peers (42 units equivalent to three 12-unit courses and one 6-unit course). This combination is proven to help IIS students to broaden their skills quickly. The MIIS degree is offered in two options: Option 1. Standard MIIS degree (MIIS-16) - A 16-month track that is completed in three academic semesters (fall, spring, fall) and a summer internship. Option 2.

They also developed linked-list data structures, the foundation of computer programming. Perlis, Simon and Newell are credited with defining the term \u201ccomputer science\u201d as \u201cthe theory and design of computers,\u201d as well as (in Newell\u2019s words) \u201cthe study of the phenomena arising from them.\u201d In 1958, Perlis began teaching the first freshman-level computer programming course in the United States at Carnegie Tech.\n| \nTuring Awards and a Nobel Prize\n\nIn 1975, Simon and Newell were awarded the A.M. Turing Award for their work in artificial intelligence. (As of 2014, 12 CMU alumni or faculty have been awarded Turings, sometimes considered the Nobel Prize of computing.) Three years later, Simon received the Nobel Prize in Economics for his work on decision-making theory. As the 1970s progressed, Newell became interested in human-computer interaction, and began a long relationship with Xerox\u2019s Palo Alto Research Center, or PARC, which released the Xerox Alto in 1973. Considered a forerunner to many of the computing environments that followed, Alto featured a graphical-user interface and was among the first commercially available workstations controlled with a mouse. Inspired by Alto, Reddy launched a drive for development of CMU\u2019s own \u201cthree-M\u201d machine\u2014a personal workstation with a megabyte of memory, a megapixel display and at least one million instructions per second of processing power.\n",

Typical errors include acronyms, named entities and domain-specific special words for which little or no data is available. To address the problem of recognizing these words, we propose an self-supervised continual learning approach. Given the audio of a lecture talk with corresponding slides, we bias the model towards decoding new words from the slides by using a memory-enhanced ASR model from previous work. Then, we perform inference on the talk, collecting utterances that contain detected new words into an adaptation dataset. Continual learning is then performed on this set by adapting low-rank matrix weights added to each weight matrix of the model. The whole procedure is iterated for many talks. We show that with this approach, we obtain increasing performance on the new words when they occur more frequently (more than 80% recall) while preserving the general performance of the model.|Author: A. Waibel Title: Convoifilter: A case study of doing cocktail party speech recognition Publication year: 2023 Coauthors: T. Nguyen, A. Waibel Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end model designed to improve automatic speech recognition (ASR) for a particular speaker in a crowded, noisy environment. The model utilizes a single-channel speech enhancement module that isolates the speaker's voice from background noise (ConVoiFilter) and an ASR module. The model can decrease ASR's word error rate (WER) from 80% to 26.4% through this approach. Typically, these two components are adjusted independently due to variations in data requirements. However, speech enhancement can create anomalies that decrease ASR efficiency. By implementing a joint fine-tuning strategy, the model can reduce the WER from 26.4% in separate tuning to 14.5% in joint tuning.

Robinson, Perez Ogayo, David R. Mortensen, Graham Neubig Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) implicitly learn to perform a range of language tasks, including machine translation (MT). Previous studies explore aspects of LLMs\u2019 MT capabilities. However, there exist a wide variety of languages for which recent LLM MT performance has never before been evaluated. Without published experimental evidence on the matter, it is difficult for speakers of the world\u2019s diverse languages to know how and whether they can use LLMs for their languages. We present the first experimental evidence for an expansive set of 204 languages, along with MT cost analysis, using the FLORES-200 benchmark. Trends reveal that GPT models approach or exceed traditional MT model performance for some high-resource languages (HRLs) but consistently lag for low-resource languages (LRLs), under-performing traditional MT for 84.1% of languages we covered. Our analysis reveals that a language\u2019s resource level is the most important feature in determining ChatGPT\u2019s relative ability to translate it, and suggests that ChatGPT is especially disadvantaged for LRLs and African languages.",

Chiu, Daniel Fried Abstract: When a model is trying to gather information in an interactive setting, it benefits from asking informative questions. However, in the case of a grounded multi-turn image identification task, previous studies have been constrained to polar yes/no questions, limiting how much information the model can gain in a single turn. We present an approach that formulates more informative, open-ended questions. In doing so, we discover that off-the-shelf visual question answering (VQA) models often make presupposition errors, which standard information gain question selection methods fail to account for. To address this issue, we propose a method that can incorporate presupposition handling into both question selection and belief updates. Specifically, we use a two-stage process, where the model first filters out images which are irrelevant to a given question, then updates its beliefs about which image the user intends. Through self-play and human evaluations, we show that our method is successful in asking informative open-ended questions, increasing accuracy over the past state-of-the-art by 14%, while resulting in 48% more efficient games in human evaluations.",

Publication year: 2023 Coauthors: A. Luccioni, Yacine Jernite, Emma Strubell Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in the popularity of commercial AI products based on generative, multi-purpose AI systems promising a unified approach to building machine learning (ML) models into technology. However, this ambition of\"generality\"comes at a steep cost to the environment, given the amount of energy these systems require and the amount of carbon that they emit. In this work, we propose the first systematic comparison of the ongoing inference cost of various categories of ML systems, covering both task-specific (i.e. finetuned models that carry out a single task) and `general-purpose' models, (i.e. those trained for multiple tasks). We measure deployment cost as the amount of energy and carbon required to perform 1,000 inferences on representative benchmark dataset using these models. We find that multi-purpose, generative architectures are orders of magnitude more expensive than task-specific systems for a variety of tasks, even when controlling for the number of model parameters. We conclude with a discussion around the current trend of deploying multi-purpose generative ML systems, and caution that their utility should be more intentionally weighed against increased costs in terms of energy and emissions. All the data from our study can be accessed via an interactive demo to carry out further exploration and analysis.",

The prompts used by companies to guide their models are often treated as secrets, to be hidden from the user making the query. They have even been treated as commodities to be bought and sold. However, anecdotal reports have shown adversarial users employing prompt extraction attacks to recover these prompts. In this paper, we present a framework for systematically measuring the effectiveness of these attacks. In experiments with 3 different sources of prompts and 11 underlying large language models, we find that simple text-based attacks can in fact reveal prompts with high probability. Our framework determines with high precision whether an extracted prompt is the actual secret prompt, rather than a model hallucination. Prompt extraction experiments on real systems such as Bing Chat and ChatGPT suggest that system prompts can be revealed by an adversary despite existing defenses in place.|Author: A.

Waibel Abstract: Inverse text normalization (ITN) is the task that transforms text in spoken-form into written-form. While automatic speech recognition (ASR) produces text in spoken-form, human and natural language understanding systems prefer to consume text in written-form. ITN generally deals with semiotic phrases (e.g., numbers, date, time). However, lack of studies to deal with phonetization phrases, which is ASR\u2019s output when it handles unseen data (e.g., foreign-named entities, domain names), although these exist in the same form in the spoken-form text. The reason is that phonetization phrases are infinite patterns and language-dependent. In this study, we introduce a novel end2end model that can handle both semiotic phrases (SEP) and phonetization phrases (PHP), named AdapITN. We call it \"Adap\" because it allows for handling unseen PHP. The model performs only when necessary by providing a mechanism to narrow normalized regions and external query knowledge, reducing the runtime significantly.",

Salakhutdinov, A. Azaria, Tom M. Mitchell, Yuan-Fang Li Abstract: Open-world survival games pose significant challenges for AI algorithms due to their multi-tasking, deep exploration, and goal prioritization requirements. Despite reinforcement learning (RL) being popular for solving games, its high sample complexity limits its effectiveness in complex open-world games like Crafter or Minecraft. We propose a novel approach, SPRING, to read the game's original academic paper and use the knowledge learned to reason and play the game through a large language model (LLM). Prompted with the LaTeX source as game context and a description of the agent's current observation, our SPRING framework employs a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with game-related questions as nodes and dependencies as edges. We identify the optimal action to take in the environment by traversing the DAG and calculating LLM responses for each node in topological order, with the LLM's answer to final node directly translating to environment actions. In our experiments, we study the quality of in-context\"reasoning\"induced by different forms of prompts under the setting of the Crafter open-world environment. Our experiments suggest that LLMs, when prompted with consistent chain-of-thought, have great potential in completing sophisticated high-level trajectories. Quantitatively, SPRING with GPT-4 outperforms all state-of-the-art RL baselines, trained for 1M steps, without any training.

Xu, Hao Zhu, Xuhui Zhou, Robert Lo, Abishek Sridhar, Xianyi Cheng, Yonatan Bisk, Daniel Fried, Uri Alon, Graham Neubig Abstract: With advances in generative AI, there is now potential for autonomous agents to manage daily tasks via natural language commands. However, current agents are primarily created and tested in simplified synthetic environments, leading to a disconnect with real-world scenarios. In this paper, we build an environment for language-guided agents that is highly realistic and reproducible. Specifically, we focus on agents that perform tasks on the web, and create an environment with fully functional websites from four common domains: e-commerce, social forum discussions, collaborative software development, and content management. Our environment is enriched with tools (e.g., a map) and external knowledge bases (e.g., user manuals) to encourage human-like task-solving. Building upon our environment, we release a set of benchmark tasks focusing on evaluating the functional correctness of task completions. The tasks in our benchmark are diverse, long-horizon, and designed to emulate tasks that humans routinely perform on the internet. We experiment with several baseline agents, integrating recent techniques such as reasoning before acting. The results demonstrate that solving complex tasks is challenging: our best GPT-4-based agent only achieves an end-to-end task success rate of 14.41%, significantly lower than the human performance of 78.24%. These results highlight the need for further development of robust agents, that current state-of-the-art large language models are far from perfect performance in these real-life tasks, and that WebArena can be used to measure such progress.",

This tech report describes the progress of the collaboration until December 2022, outlining the current state of the Personally Identifiable Information (PII) redaction pipeline, the experiments conducted to de-risk the model architecture, and the experiments investigating better preprocessing methods for the training data. We train 1.1B parameter models on the Java, JavaScript, and Python subsets of The Stack and evaluate them on the MultiPL-E text-to-code benchmark. We find that more aggressive filtering of near-duplicates can further boost performance and, surprisingly, that selecting files from repositories with 5+ GitHub stars deteriorates performance significantly. Our best model outperforms previous open-source multilingual code generation models (InCoder-6.7B and CodeGen-Multi-2.7B) in both left-to-right generation and infilling on the Java, JavaScript, and Python portions of MultiPL-E, despite being a substantially smaller model.

Diab Abstract: We conduct a thorough investigation into the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing specifically on the Open Pretrained Transformers (OPT) models as a representative of such models. Our study entails finetuning three different sizes of OPT on a carefully curated reasoning corpus, resulting in two sets of finetuned models: OPT-R, finetuned without explanations, and OPT-RE, finetuned with explanations. We then evaluate all models on 57 out-of-domain tasks drawn from the Super-NaturalInstructions benchmark, covering 26 distinct reasoning skills, utilizing three prompting techniques. Through a comprehensive grid of 27 configurations and 6,156 test evaluations, we investigate the dimensions of finetuning, prompting, and scale to understand the role of explanations on different reasoning skills. Our findings reveal that having explanations in the fewshot exemplar has no significant impact on the model\u2019s performance when the model is finetuned, while positively affecting the non-finetuned counterpart. Moreover, we observe a slight yet consistent increase in classification accuracy as we incorporate explanations during prompting and finetuning, respectively. Finally, we offer insights on which reasoning skills benefit the most from incorporating explanations during finetuning and prompting, such as Numerical (+20.4%) and Analogical (+13.9%) reasoning, as well as skills that exhibit negligible or negative effects.",

In the past, gesture generation models assumed that data for each speaker is available all at once, and in large amounts. However in practical scenarios, speaker data comes sequentially and in small amounts as the agent personalizes with more speakers, akin to a continual learning paradigm. While more recent works have shown progress in adapting to low-resource data, they catastrophically forget the gesture styles of initial speakers they were trained on. Also, prior generative continual learning works are not multimodal, making this space less studied. In this paper, we explore this new paradigm and propose C-DiffGAN: an approach that continually learns new speaker gesture styles with only a few minutes of per-speaker data, while retaining previously learnt styles. Inspired by prior continual learning works, C-DiffGAN encourages knowledge retention by 1) generating reminiscences of previous low-resource speaker data, then 2) crossmodally aligning to them to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. We quantitatively demonstrate improved performance and reduced forgetting over strong baselines through standard continual learning measures, reinforced by a qualitative user study that shows that our method produces more natural, style-preserving gestures.

Recent research has hinted in the affirmative, finding that brain signals can be effectively predicted using the internal representations of language models (LMs). Although such results are thought to reflect shared computational principles between LMs and human brains, there are also clear differences in how LMs and humans represent and use language. In this work, we systematically explore the divergences between human and machine language processing by examining the differences between LM representations and human brain responses to language as measured by Magnetoencephalography (MEG) across two datasets in which subjects read and listened to narrative stories. Using a data-driven approach, we identify two domains that are not captured well by LMs: social/emotional intelligence and physical commonsense. We then validate these domains with human behavioral experiments and show that fine-tuning LMs on these domains can improve their alignment with human brain responses.",

Inspired by Alto, Reddy launched a drive for development of CMU\u2019s own \u201cthree-M\u201d machine\u2014a personal workstation with a megabyte of memory, a megapixel display and at least one million instructions per second of processing power.\n|Carnegie Mellon University has been a birthplace of innovation since its founding in 1900. Today, CMU is a global leader bringing groundbreaking ideas to market and creating successful startup businesses. Our award-winning faculty are renowned for working closely with students to solve major scientific, technological and societal challenges. We put a strong emphasis on creating things \u2014 from art to robots. We have become a model for economic development in forming partnerships with companies such as Uber, Google and Disney.

Here are 25 great ideas from CMU computer scientists to think about as we celebrate the birthday of the School of Computer Science.1. Artificial intelligence, 1955-56\u00a0Can you write a working computer program without a computer? Herb Simon (H\u201990), at left, Allen Newell (IA\u201957), at right, and Cliff Shaw did. The team created the first artificial intelligence program, Logic Theorist, which could solve logic puzzles in the same way that a human might solve them. Newell demonstrated that it worked by writing the instructions on 3-by-5 index cards that were manipulated on the kitchen table by Newell, his wife, and a group of Carnegie Tech grad students.",

Previous studies explore aspects of LLMs\u2019 MT capabilities. However, there exist a wide variety of languages for which recent LLM MT performance has never before been evaluated. Without published experimental evidence on the matter, it is difficult for speakers of the world\u2019s diverse languages to know how and whether they can use LLMs for their languages. We present the first experimental evidence for an expansive set of 204 languages, along with MT cost analysis, using the FLORES-200 benchmark. Trends reveal that GPT models approach or exceed traditional MT model performance for some high-resource languages (HRLs) but consistently lag for low-resource languages (LRLs), under-performing traditional MT for 84.1% of languages we covered. Our analysis reveals that a language\u2019s resource level is the most important feature in determining ChatGPT\u2019s relative ability to translate it, and suggests that ChatGPT is especially disadvantaged for LRLs and African languages.|Author: David R.

The sections below provide more detail about each of these requirements. 3.1.1 Course Requirements To complete the course requirements for the Ph.D. in Language and Information Technologies degree, the student must pass 96 or more course units of graduate courses, and meet the following criteria: \u2022 At least 72 units of \u201cLTI\u201d courses and 24 units of \u201cSCS\u201d courses, \u2022 At least one class in each \u201cLTI Focus Area\u201d, and \u2022 At least two labs, in two different research areas . For definitions of quoted terms, see the section on \u201cDefinitions of LTI Terminology\u201d. Unless approved by the Program Director in advance, the course requirements must be satisfied by actual classroom courses, not credit given for research or independent study. An \u201cLTI course \u201d is any 12-unit course with a number of 11-XXX; a 6-unit course with 11-XXX counts as one-half of an LTI course. Unless otherwise specified, \"course\" means an actual classroom course, not credit given for research or independent study. Note that the LTI allow s any one MLD (10-XXX) graduate course to count as an \"LTI course\".

Ph.D. students are expected to publish papers about original research in the most competitive scientific journals and international conference proceedings, and to present their research at conferences and workshops. Most of our Ph.D. graduates become professors and research scientists, while a few have started their own companies.|LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook Page 15 outside of the SCS now count towards this requirement; for example, Digital Signal Processing in ECE.

They will decide, with advice from faculty in the appropriate area, whether it should be in the Focus Area. I f approved , it will be added to the LTI Focus Area webpage. A \u201cTask-Orientation Focus Course \u201d is a course belonging to that LTI Focus Area, as listed on the LTI\u2019s \u201cCourse Categories\u201d webpage.

Minimum grade: Only courses with a grade of B (3.0) or higher are counted as satisfying a degree requirement. Pass/fail: Pass/fail grades are not permitted for courses and projects used to satisfy a degree requirement. 3.1.3 Proficiency Requirements The LTI Ph.D. does not require any Qualifying Exams. Instead, a LTI Ph.D. student is required to demonstrate proficiency in the following four areas. \u2022 Writing: This is satisfied by producing a peer-reviewed conference paper, or the equivalent (a written report that at least two SCS faculty certify as being of conference-paper quality). \u2022 Presentation: This is satisfied by the oral presentation of a conference paper, or the equivalent (an oral presentation that at least t wo SCS faculty certify as being of conference-talk quality). \u2022 Programming: This is satisfied by demonstrating competence in computer programming of language technology; this is normally satisfied in the course of the student's research and/or project work",

        "question": "Does LTI allow its masters to transfer to PhD program?",
        "context": "Transferring Into the Ph.D.  Program  \nThe LTI does not allow direct transfers from its master\u2019s programs into its Ph.D.  program .",
        "retrieved_doc": "LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook Page 26 4.1.7 Transferring Into the Ph.D. Program The LTI does not allow direct transfers from its master\u2019s programs into its Ph.D. program . The student must apply for the Ph.D. at the usual time . However, students that are already enrolled in an LTI degree program are not required to retake GRE and TOEFL exams or to produce new transcripts from other universities. 4.1.8 Transferring Out of the Ph.D. Program The Ph.D. program doe s not prevent students from transferring to another degree program . A student who is interested in transferring out of the Ph.D. degree program should consult the handbook and Program Director of the desired degree program to learn whether transfers are permitted, and if so, how, and when to request such a transfer. 4.2 LTI Academic Policies 4.2.1 \u201cGrandfather\u201d Policy A student can graduate under the policies in effect at the time that the student entered the program; or, at the student's choice, the student can graduate under policies that are adopted after the student entered the program. If it is not realistic to follow a particular policy exactly, the department may approximate the policy as closely as possible; this situation is rare and typically arises only when a student is enrolled in the program for an extended period of time. 4.2.2 Definition of Transfer Credit vs. Course Exemption The LT I may grant transfer credit or issue an exemption for equivalent graduate courses previously completed at another institution. This decision rests with the director of the particular program. If a student is exempt from a required course due to prior cour ses or experience, the student can replace that course with an open elective. The student does not receive credit for the external course but can take any course that could normally count toward the degree in its place. If a student receives credit for pr ior coursework completed at CMU or elsewhere, the student receives that many units of credit, and the total amount of required coursework is reduced by that amount. 4.2.3 External Employment/Consulting Students funded by LTI research projects are expected to wor k primarily for those projects. Since consulting provides useful experience, students are generally permitted to consult at most one day per seven-day week, with the advisor's consent . International students must also have approval in advance from the Office of International Education (OIE) ; otherwise, they may be in violation of their visa status. See also External Internships|MLT Graduate Student Handbook Page 15 How and when the advisor is selected: the Marriage Process: Advisors are selected during the first month of the program. Students are expected to attend the LTI's Orientation (\u201cImmigration Course ,\u201d or IC) lectures, in which faculty describe their interests and areas of expertise, and to be proactive about meeting individually with potential advisors. After meeting with several potential advisors, each student will be asked to indicate a firs t, second, and third choice for advisor. Meanwhile, the potential advisors determine how many new students they can take, and indicate their preferences. Finally, the entire LTI faculty meets as a \u201c Marriage Committee \u201d to determine the best set of matches. Some entering MLT students are prefunded, meaning they have received and accepted a funding letter from a faculty member before the Marriage Process. (Even students who are prefunded must attend the research talks, to become acquainted with the LTI\u2019s rese arch projects.) Even self-supporting MLT students are expected to perform research with a faculty advisor, since research experience is an important part of our graduate programs. Until a student finds a specific advisor, the chair of the LTI graduate prog rams serves as the advisor. How to change advisors: The initial advisor selection should be made carefully. However, it is possible to change advisors. To do so, the student should find another faculty member willing to serve as an advisor, and then make a request to the Program Director to switch advisors. The LTI follows the long-standing SCS policy that both the new and old advisors need to agree to the change; typically, this is not a problem ( assuming the new advisor has agreed in advance, as described here ). It is to the student's advantage to avoid switching advisors, especially late in their graduate studies, because forging a strong student-advisor relationship takes time. 4.3 Optional Masters\u2019 Thesis MLT students may optionally elect to complete a Mast ers\u2019 Thesis; it is not required. Students who intend to apply for the PhD program should consider the MLT Thesis as one of several ways to demonstrate their research potential. Other possibilities include innovative research in a research project or class project work. The MLT Thesis must be completed according to the following guidelines. Note in particular the October 31 proposal deadline! \u2022 There are two course components required for students who elect to complete the M.S. Thesis: 11-928 \u2013 Masters \u2019 Thesis I (with the chosen thesis advisor, typically for 12 units, typically in the Fall of their second year) and 11-929 \u2013 Masters \u2019 Thesis II in the following Spring. \u2022 Each of these two courses counts towards 6 units of MLT-level LTI course credit; if the student goes on to an LTI PhD, the second course (11-929) counts towards one PhD lab requirement. \u2022 The MLT thesis may focus on either a significant research result or a significant implementation of a new technology. The student should work with their adv isor to define an interesting but bounded thesis research project.

These standards require personal integrity, a commitment to honesty without compromise, as well as truth without equivocation and a willingne ss to place the good of the community above the good of the self. Obligations once un dertaken must be me t, commitments kept. As members of the Carnegie Mellon community , individuals are expected to uphold the standards of the community in a ddition to holding others accountable for said standards. It is rare that the life of a student in an academic community can be so private that it will not affect the community as a whole or that the above standards do not apply. The discovery, advancement, and communicatio n of knowledge are not possible without a commitment to these standards. Creativity cannot exist without acknowledgment of the creativity of others. New knowledge cannot be developed without credit for prior knowledge. Without the ability to trust that these princ iples will be observed, an academic community cannot exist. The commitment of its faculty, staff, and students to these standards contributes to the high respect in which the Carnegie Mellon degree is he ld. Students must not de stroy that respect by",

Under U.S. Federal Title IV regulations, student eligibility for federal financial aid is contingent upon enrollment in and successful completion of courses that are counted as credit toward their current degree program. To receive the maximum amount of federal financial aid for which they may be eligible, students must enroll each se mester in at least 36 units that count toward their current degree level. (See separate guidance regarding integrated degree completion.) Students should consult with their designated college liaison in The HUB regarding billing and financial aid, particu larly for early completion, longer-than-standard completion, or integrated undergraduate and master\u2019s degree programs. 3.11.3 International Students Immigration status for students in F-1 and J-1 non-immigrant status is tied to making normal progress toward completing degree requirements. Therefore, F-1 and J-1 students who are considering completing their degree requirements early, anticipating longer-than-standard completion, or moving from an undergraduate to a graduate student classification (integ rated undergraduate-graduate study) should consult with their designated advisor in the Office of International Education (OIE) to ensure compliance with immigration regulations. 4 Ph.D. Academic Policies 4.1 Duration of Study The target duration of the LTI Ph.D. is five years, although six years is also common. Carnegie Mellon graduate students are expected to complete their degree requirements within the standard length of time for their program of study as outlined in this Graduate Student Handbook. Upon completion of the graduate program degree requirements, the degree will be certified by the student\u2019s academic program in the semester in which the student completes the requirements. Early Completion The Ph.D. is granted when all degree requirements are satisfied. Some students complete the program in fewer than five years|LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook Page 25 Note that self-funded Ph.D. students (e.g., those registered for five units while on semester interns hip) are not permitted to receive a partial stipend for the semester of their internship, while full-time LTI-sponsored students are eligible for a partial stipend. All students are caution ed to be aware of potential intellectual property (IP) problems with internships, and to review any IP agreements with their advisors before signing them. It is possible to lose ownership of your ideas. If the student is to receive academic credit for the internship, it must have deliverables from the student commensurate with the number of units, they are taking. This can be in the form of interim and final reports on the experience, presentations in the following semester regarding the experience, assessments of their experience as it relates to their course of study, etc. 4.1.3 Maximum Courseload Ph.D. students are permitted to register for a maximum of 54 units of coursework per semester. 4.1.4 Pass/Fail Grades Pass/fail grades are not permitted for courses used to satisfy a degree requirement. Graduate students who are required to take additional undergraduate courses to build up the core foundations of computer science may not elect the pass/fail option for th ese courses. 4.1.5 Transfer Credit An equivalent graduate course previously completed at another institution may be permitted to satisfy one of the Ph.D. course requirements. The decision on whether a course may be transferred is made by the Ph.D. Program Direct or. Typically, the student will provide the Program Director with the syllabus of the external course, and the Program Director will use that and the student\u2019s transcript to make the decision. See the section on \u201cDefinition of transfer credit versus cour se exemption .\u201d A student may not receive transfer credit for more than four courses. 4.1.6 Residency Requirements The university requires Ph.D. s to spend at least one year of residency at Carnegie Mellon.
