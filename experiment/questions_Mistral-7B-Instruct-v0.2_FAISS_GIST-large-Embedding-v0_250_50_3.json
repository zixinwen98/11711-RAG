You have joined a Ph.D. program that focuses on excellence, creativity, and training the next generation of research leaders. While the next few \nyears will be a time of hard work and intense concentration, we hope that your time at the LTI \nwill also be rewarding professionally and personally.  \nObtaining a Ph.D. is a long and often intense journey. A healthy work -life balance helps to keep it \nin perspective. Carnegie Mellon  is located in Pittsburgh, a city with a rich industrial and labor \nheritage. In the past, it was the heart of the U.S. steel industry, a source  for quality packaged foods, \nan important financial hub, and an early pioneer in railroads, radio, and nuclear power. This is a \ncity where people worked hard and made things that changed the world. Today, Pittsburgh has \nreinvented itself as a leader in Computer Science and medicine, but it is still a place where people \nwork hard and make things that change the world . It is also an informal city, where people don\u2019t \ntake themselves too seriously and remember to have fun. It is home to excellent museums, competitive professional sports teams, inexpensive magic shows, and free music during the \nsummer, with skiing and magnificent  state parks nearby. Your stay here will be more rewarding \nif you make time for e xploring  the many activities that Pittsburgh and Southwest Pennsylvania \nhave to offer. \nThere are significant differences between CMU's different departments and degree programs in \nphilosophical approach, procedures, policies, and regulations. Each department issues a \nhandbook that informs graduate students of their program requirements and procedures and \nensures that students have written access to standard information. This handbook describes the \npolicies, procedures, and requirements for the Ph.D.  in Language and Information Technologies.  \nAll policies not explicitly described in this document conform to School of Computer Science (SCS) policies and university policies. For information about Carnegie Mellon requirements and policies, please see the university\u2019s handbook The Word\n, the Office of Graduate and Postdoctoral \nAffairs web page , the Office of the Dean of Students web page , and other resources contained in \nAppendix A of this handbook.  \nWelcome!

The \nstudent must apply for the Ph.D.  at the usual time . However, students that are already enrolled in \nan LTI degree program are not required to retake GRE and TOEFL exams or to produce new \ntranscripts from other universities.  \n4.1.8 Transferring Out of the Ph.D.  Program  \nThe Ph.D.  program doe s not prevent students from transferring to another degree program . A \nstudent who is interested in transferring out of the Ph.D.  degree program should consult the \nhandbook and Program Director of the desired degree program to learn whether transfers are permitted, and if so, how, and when to request such a transfer.  \n4.2 LTI Academic Policies  \n4.2.1 \u201cGrandfather\u201d Policy  \nA student can graduate under the policies in effect at the time that the student entered the \nprogram; or, at the student's choice, the student can graduate under policies that are adopted after \nthe student entered the program. If it is not realistic to follow a particular policy  exactly, the \ndepartment may approximate the policy as closely as possible; this situation is rare and typically arises only when a student is enrolled in the program for an extended period of time.  \n4.2.2 Definition of Transfer Credit  vs. Course Exemption  \nThe LT I may grant transfer credit  or issue an exemption for equivalent graduate courses previously \ncompleted at another institution. This decision rests with the director  of the particular program.  \nIf a student is exempt  from a required course due to prior cour ses or experience, the student can \nreplace that course with an open elective. The student does not receive credit for the external course but  can take any course that could normally count toward the degree in its place.  \nIf a student receives credit  for pr ior coursework completed at CMU or elsewhere, the student \nreceives that many units of credit, and the total amount of required coursework is reduced by that \namount.  \n4.2.3 External Employment/Consulting  \nStudents funded by LTI research projects are expected to wor k primarily for those projects. Since \nconsulting provides useful experience, students are generally permitted to consult at most one \nday per seven- day week, with the advisor's consent . International students must also have \napproval in advance from the Office of International Education (OIE) ; otherwise, they may be in \nviolation of their visa status.

Any graduate course (600 -level or higher) offered by the Language Technologies \nInstitute; and  \nb. Any graduate course (600 -level or higher) from the  list of approved qualifying \ncourses  (Section 3. 2.4). \n2. Free elective:  Students must pass 12 units (typically 1 course) in elective master\u2019s  \ncourse(s). A free elective is defined as:  \na. A graduate course (600 -level or higher)  with content relevant to the MIIS \nprogram objectives offered  by the School of Computer Science ; and  \nb. A course approved by the student's advisor and the degree Program Director.  \nc. A student may not use the same course to satisfy both a qualifying course \nrequirement and an elective course requirement.  \n3. Breadth requirements : Students must demonstrate breadth by passing one  course in \neach of the following areas. In addition, MIIS -21 students must take two more LTI \ncourses (24 units total) in one of the following areas of concentration:  \n\u2022 Human language;  \n\u2022 Machine learning; and  \n\u2022 Language technology applications.  \n The department maintains and publishes a list of courses  that satisfy each of these \nrequirements (Sections 3. 2.5 \u2013 3.2.7). Some c ourses  used to satisfy a breadth requirement \ncan also satisfy qualifying course requirements.  A student should get approval from the \ndirector for the breadth courses , if not listed below.  \n4.4 Approved Qualifying Courses  \nAny graduate course  (600 -level or higher) offered by the Language Technologies Institute is \na qualifying course.  \nAny two graduate courses (600 -level or higher) offered by departments within the SCS  \nrelevant to the MIIS degree other than LTI (Machine Learning or Computer Science departments, etc.) may be counted as approved qualifying courses .  |MIIS Graduate Student Handbook  Page 13  \n 4 MIIS Degree Requirements and Related Policies/Protocols  \n4.1 Program Options  \nThe MIIS degree is offered in  two options:  \nOption 1.  Standard MIIS degree  (MIIS -16) - A 16 -month track that is completed in three \nacademic semesters (fall, spring, fall) and a summer internship.  \nOption 2.

Curricular requirements ensure that MIIS students receive \ninstruction in core intelligent information systems technologies while also allowing an \nopportunity to specialize in areas of personal interest.  Practice requirements are opportunities \nto apply and hone new skills while building state -of-the-art systems. Grade  requirements ensure \nthat students have demonstrated a certain level of sk ill while completing degree requirements. \nAll three types of requirements are described below.  \nMIIS -16 students must take at least 84 units (typically 7 12 -unit courses) of qualifying and \nelective courses that satisfy human language, machine learning, and language technology \napplications breadth requirements and 66 practice units for a total of 150 units to attain the \nStandard MIIS degree.  \nMIIS -21 students must take at least 108 units (typically 9 12 -unit courses) of qualifying and \nelective courses and 66 practice units to satisfy their degree requirements, making it a total of 174 units to attain the MIIS: Advanced Study degree. \n4.3 Core Requirements  | \nMaster of Science in Intelligent Information Systems (MIIS) Requirements: \n\nThe Intelligent Information Systems degree offers students the flexibility to create their own course of study in consultation with their advisor. \n\nMIIS students gain three types of practical experience: software development supervised by their advisor (24 units equivalent to two courses); a summer internship (which can be waived for students that have sufficient prior professional experience); and a capstone project executed in a group of peers (42 units equivalent to three 12-unit courses and one 6-unit course). This combination is proven to help IIS students to broaden their skills quickly. The MIIS degree is offered in two options:\n\nOption 1. Standard MIIS degree (MIIS-16) - A 16-month track that is completed in three academic semesters (fall, spring, fall) and a summer internship.  \n\nOption 2.

The \nstudent must apply for the Ph.D.  at the usual time . However, students that are already enrolled in \nan LTI degree program are not required to retake GRE and TOEFL exams or to produce new \ntranscripts from other universities.  \n4.1.8 Transferring Out of the Ph.D.  Program  \nThe Ph.D.  program doe s not prevent students from transferring to another degree program . A \nstudent who is interested in transferring out of the Ph.D.  degree program should consult the \nhandbook and Program Director of the desired degree program to learn whether transfers are permitted, and if so, how, and when to request such a transfer.  \n4.2 LTI Academic Policies  \n4.2.1 \u201cGrandfather\u201d Policy  \nA student can graduate under the policies in effect at the time that the student entered the \nprogram; or, at the student's choice, the student can graduate under policies that are adopted after \nthe student entered the program. If it is not realistic to follow a particular policy  exactly, the \ndepartment may approximate the policy as closely as possible; this situation is rare and typically arises only when a student is enrolled in the program for an extended period of time.  \n4.2.2 Definition of Transfer Credit  vs. Course Exemption  \nThe LT I may grant transfer credit  or issue an exemption for equivalent graduate courses previously \ncompleted at another institution. This decision rests with the director  of the particular program.  \nIf a student is exempt  from a required course due to prior cour ses or experience, the student can \nreplace that course with an open elective. The student does not receive credit for the external course but  can take any course that could normally count toward the degree in its place.  \nIf a student receives credit  for pr ior coursework completed at CMU or elsewhere, the student \nreceives that many units of credit, and the total amount of required coursework is reduced by that \namount.  \n4.2.3 External Employment/Consulting  \nStudents funded by LTI research projects are expected to wor k primarily for those projects. Since \nconsulting provides useful experience, students are generally permitted to consult at most one \nday per seven- day week, with the advisor's consent . International students must also have \napproval in advance from the Office of International Education (OIE) ; otherwise, they may be in \nviolation of their visa status. See also External Internships.  | \nDual-Degree Ph.D. in Language and Information Technologies (Portugal Partnership) Requirments: Students participating in the dual-degree program will spend their first year in Portugal, followed by two years in Pittsburgh to complete their coursework.

Waibel Title: Convoifilter: A case study of doing cocktail party speech recognition Publication year: 2023 Coauthors: T. Nguyen, A. Waibel Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end model designed to improve automatic speech recognition (ASR) for a particular speaker in a crowded, noisy environment. The model utilizes a single-channel speech enhancement module that isolates the speaker's voice from background noise (ConVoiFilter) and an ASR module. The model can decrease ASR's word error rate (WER) from 80% to 26.4% through this approach. Typically, these two components are adjusted independently due to variations in data requirements. However, speech enhancement can create anomalies that decrease ASR efficiency. By implementing a joint fine-tuning strategy, the model can reduce the WER from 26.4% in separate tuning to 14.5% in joint tuning.

Previous studies explore aspects of LLMs\u2019 MT capabilities. However, there exist a wide variety of languages for which recent LLM MT performance has never before been evaluated. Without published experimental evidence on the matter, it is difficult for speakers of the world\u2019s diverse languages to know how and whether they can use LLMs for their languages. We present the first experimental evidence for an expansive set of 204 languages, along with MT cost analysis, using the FLORES-200 benchmark. Trends reveal that GPT models approach or exceed traditional MT model performance for some high-resource languages (HRLs) but consistently lag for low-resource languages (LRLs), under-performing traditional MT for 84.1% of languages we covered. Our analysis reveals that a language\u2019s resource level is the most important feature in determining ChatGPT\u2019s relative ability to translate it, and suggests that ChatGPT is especially disadvantaged for LRLs and African languages.",

The prompts used by companies to guide their models are often treated as secrets, to be hidden from the user making the query. They have even been treated as commodities to be bought and sold. However, anecdotal reports have shown adversarial users employing prompt extraction attacks to recover these prompts. In this paper, we present a framework for systematically measuring the effectiveness of these attacks. In experiments with 3 different sources of prompts and 11 underlying large language models, we find that simple text-based attacks can in fact reveal prompts with high probability. Our framework determines with high precision whether an extracted prompt is the actual secret prompt, rather than a model hallucination. Prompt extraction experiments on real systems such as Bing Chat and ChatGPT suggest that system prompts can be revealed by an adversary despite existing defenses in place.|Author: A. Waibel Title: AdapITN: A Fast, Reliable, and Dynamic Adaptive Inverse Text Normalization Publication year: 2023 Coauthors: T. Nguyen, Le Duc Minh Nhat, Quang Minh Nguyen, Quoc Truong Do, C. Luong, A. Waibel Abstract: Inverse text normalization (ITN) is the task that transforms text in spoken-form into written-form. While automatic speech recognition (ASR) produces text in spoken-form, human and natural language understanding systems prefer to consume text in written-form. ITN generally deals with semiotic phrases (e.g., numbers, date, time). However, lack of studies to deal with phonetization phrases, which is ASR\u2019s output when it handles unseen data (e.g., foreign-named entities, domain names), although these exist in the same form in the spoken-form text. The reason is that phonetization phrases are infinite patterns and language-dependent. In this study, we introduce a novel end2end model that can handle both semiotic phrases (SEP) and phonetization phrases (PHP), named AdapITN. We call it \"Adap\" because it allows for handling unseen PHP. The model performs only when necessary by providing a mechanism to narrow normalized regions and external query knowledge, reducing the runtime significantly.",

Salakhutdinov, A. Azaria, Tom M. Mitchell, Yuan-Fang Li Abstract: Open-world survival games pose significant challenges for AI algorithms due to their multi-tasking, deep exploration, and goal prioritization requirements. Despite reinforcement learning (RL) being popular for solving games, its high sample complexity limits its effectiveness in complex open-world games like Crafter or Minecraft. We propose a novel approach, SPRING, to read the game's original academic paper and use the knowledge learned to reason and play the game through a large language model (LLM). Prompted with the LaTeX source as game context and a description of the agent's current observation, our SPRING framework employs a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with game-related questions as nodes and dependencies as edges. We identify the optimal action to take in the environment by traversing the DAG and calculating LLM responses for each node in topological order, with the LLM's answer to final node directly translating to environment actions. In our experiments, we study the quality of in-context\"reasoning\"induced by different forms of prompts under the setting of the Crafter open-world environment. Our experiments suggest that LLMs, when prompted with consistent chain-of-thought, have great potential in completing sophisticated high-level trajectories. Quantitatively, SPRING with GPT-4 outperforms all state-of-the-art RL baselines, trained for 1M steps, without any training. Finally, we show the potential of games as a test bed for LLMs.|Author: Graham Neubig Title: SOTOPIA: Interactive Evaluation for Social Intelligence in Language Agents Publication year: 2023 Coauthors: Xuhui Zhou, Hao Zhu, Leena Mathur, Ruohong Zhang, Haofei Yu, Zhengyang Qi, Louis-Philippe Morency, Yonatan Bisk, Daniel Fried, Graham Neubig, Maarten Sap Abstract: Humans are social beings; we pursue social goals in our daily interactions, which is a crucial aspect of social intelligence. Yet, AI systems' abilities in this realm remain elusive. We present SOTOPIA, an open-ended environment to simulate complex social interactions between artificial agents and evaluate their social intelligence. In our environment, agents role-play and interact under a wide variety of scenarios; they coordinate, collaborate, exchange, and compete with each other to achieve complex social goals. We simulate the role-play interaction between LLM-based agents and humans within this task space and evaluate their performance with a holistic evaluation framework called SOTOPIA-Eval. With SOTOPIA, we find significant differences between these models in terms of their social intelligence, and we identify a subset of SOTOPIA scenarios, SOTOPIA-hard, that is generally challenging for all models. We find that on this subset, GPT-4 achieves a significantly lower goal completion rate than humans and struggles to exhibit social commonsense reasoning and strategic communication skills. These findings demonstrate SOTOPIA's promise as a general platform for research on evaluating and improving social intelligence in artificial agents.",

Salakhutdinov, A. Azaria, Tom M. Mitchell, Yuan-Fang Li Abstract: Open-world survival games pose significant challenges for AI algorithms due to their multi-tasking, deep exploration, and goal prioritization requirements. Despite reinforcement learning (RL) being popular for solving games, its high sample complexity limits its effectiveness in complex open-world games like Crafter or Minecraft. We propose a novel approach, SPRING, to read the game's original academic paper and use the knowledge learned to reason and play the game through a large language model (LLM). Prompted with the LaTeX source as game context and a description of the agent's current observation, our SPRING framework employs a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with game-related questions as nodes and dependencies as edges. We identify the optimal action to take in the environment by traversing the DAG and calculating LLM responses for each node in topological order, with the LLM's answer to final node directly translating to environment actions. In our experiments, we study the quality of in-context\"reasoning\"induced by different forms of prompts under the setting of the Crafter open-world environment. Our experiments suggest that LLMs, when prompted with consistent chain-of-thought, have great potential in completing sophisticated high-level trajectories. Quantitatively, SPRING with GPT-4 outperforms all state-of-the-art RL baselines, trained for 1M steps, without any training. Finally, we show the potential of games as a test bed for LLMs.|Author: Mona T.

Diab Abstract: We conduct a thorough investigation into the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing specifically on the Open Pretrained Transformers (OPT) models as a representative of such models. Our study entails finetuning three different sizes of OPT on a carefully curated reasoning corpus, resulting in two sets of finetuned models: OPT-R, finetuned without explanations, and OPT-RE, finetuned with explanations. We then evaluate all models on 57 out-of-domain tasks drawn from the Super-NaturalInstructions benchmark, covering 26 distinct reasoning skills, utilizing three prompting techniques. Through a comprehensive grid of 27 configurations and 6,156 test evaluations, we investigate the dimensions of finetuning, prompting, and scale to understand the role of explanations on different reasoning skills. Our findings reveal that having explanations in the fewshot exemplar has no significant impact on the model\u2019s performance when the model is finetuned, while positively affecting the non-finetuned counterpart. Moreover, we observe a slight yet consistent increase in classification accuracy as we incorporate explanations during prompting and finetuning, respectively. Finally, we offer insights on which reasoning skills benefit the most from incorporating explanations during finetuning and prompting, such as Numerical (+20.4%) and Analogical (+13.9%) reasoning, as well as skills that exhibit negligible or negative effects.",

Liang, R. Salakhutdinov, Louis-Philippe Morency Abstract: Multimodal machine learning, which studies the information and interactions across various input modalities, has made significant advancements in understanding the relationship between images and descriptive text. However, this is just a portion of the potential multimodal interactions seen in the real world and does not include new interactions between conflicting utterances and gestures in predicting sarcasm, for example. Notably, the current methods for capturing shared information often do not extend well to these more nuanced interactions, sometimes performing as low as 50% in binary classification. In this paper, we address this problem via a new approach called MMOE, which stands for a mixture of multimodal interaction experts. Our method automatically classifies data points from unlabeled multimodal datasets by their interaction type and employs specialized models for each specific interaction. Based on our experiments, this approach improves performance on these challenging interactions by more than 10%, leading to an overall increase of 2% for tasks like sarcasm prediction. As a result, interaction quantification provides new insights for dataset analysis and yields simple approaches that obtain state-of-the-art performance.",

Recent research has hinted in the affirmative, finding that brain signals can be effectively predicted using the internal representations of language models (LMs). Although such results are thought to reflect shared computational principles between LMs and human brains, there are also clear differences in how LMs and humans represent and use language. In this work, we systematically explore the divergences between human and machine language processing by examining the differences between LM representations and human brain responses to language as measured by Magnetoencephalography (MEG) across two datasets in which subjects read and listened to narrative stories. Using a data-driven approach, we identify two domains that are not captured well by LMs: social/emotional intelligence and physical commonsense. We then validate these domains with human behavioral experiments and show that fine-tuning LMs on these domains can improve their alignment with human brain responses.|Author: Maarten Sap Title: Clever Hans or Neural Theory of Mind?

Recently, many anecdotal examples were used to suggest that newer large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and GPT-4 exhibit Neural Theory-of-Mind (N-ToM); however, prior work reached conflicting conclusions regarding those abilities. We investigate the extent of LLMs' N-ToM through an extensive evaluation on 6 tasks and find that while LLMs exhibit certain N-ToM abilities, this behavior is far from being robust. We further examine the factors impacting performance on N-ToM tasks and discover that LLMs struggle with adversarial examples, indicating reliance on shallow heuristics rather than robust ToM abilities. We caution against drawing conclusions from anecdotal examples, limited benchmark testing, and using human-designed psychological tests to evaluate models.",

However, the ability to send emoticons in emails came much later with the development of the MIME standard for email attachments by Nathaniel Borenstein in 1992. So while emoticons themselves predate the first smile in an email, the ability to send them in emails came later",

This decision rests with the director  of the particular program.  \nIf a student is exempt  from a required course due to prior cour ses or experience, the student can \nreplace that course with an open elective. The student does not receive credit for the external course but  can take any course that could normally count toward the degree in its place.  \nIf a student receives credit  for pr ior coursework completed at CMU or elsewhere, the student \nreceives that many units of credit, and the total amount of required coursework is reduced by that \namount.  \n4.2.3 External Employment/Consulting  \nStudents funded by LTI research projects are expected to wor k primarily for those projects. Since \nconsulting provides useful experience, students are generally permitted to consult at most one \nday per seven- day week, with the advisor's consent .

To be considered a full-time student, a student must \nbe registered for, and complete, a minimum of 36 units in every Fall and Spring semester. \nAll international students are required by US Federal law to maintain full-time status. \nStudents can have no more than one (1) remote course counting toward the 36 units used \nto satisfy full-time enrollment. Failure to maintain full-time status will result in loss of a \nstudent visa (and, therefore, \u201cpermit of stay\u201d). All students having a Stafford Loan are \nrequired to maintain full-time status. \n \n3.3 MCDS Degree Enrollment Process and Related Information \n3.3.1 Duration of the degree program \nThe MCDS degree must be completed within five (5) years from the time that the student \nmatriculates into the program. \n \nhttps://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of-\nlimitations.html  \n \nAs outlined in the Master\u2019s Students Statute of Limitations (see link above), students will \ncomplete all requirements for the master\u2019s degree within a maximum of seven years from \noriginal matriculation as a master\u2019s student, or less if required by a more restrictive \ndepartment, school or college policy. Once this time-to-degree limit has lapsed, the \nperson may resume work towards a master\u2019s degree only if newly admitted to a currently \noffered master\u2019s degree program under criteria determined by that program. \n \nUnder extraordinary circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, \nfamily or parental leave, or temporary disability, a school or college may, upon the \nrelevant department's recommendation and with the written approval of the dean (or \ndesignate), defer the lapse for a period commensurate with the duration of that \ninterruption. Students who are pursuing a master\u2019s degree as part-time students for all \nsemesters of their program, as approved by their program, may also appeal to their \nprogram or department for extension of the time to degree limit. \n \n3.3.2 Residency requirements \nThere is no formal residence requirement. However, most courses in the program are \ntaught on campus without an option for distance education. Students enrolled in in-\nperson course sections (IPR) are expected to attend all class meetings in person. \n3.3.3 Degree Certification: Course requirements and related policies/protocols |MIIS Graduate Student Handbook  Page 14  \n A MIIS  student must complete the following curricular requirements:  \n1.

Students seeking guidance about their program of study and degree \nrequirements should consult with their academic advisor and/or appropriate associate \ndean. \n \nFinancial aid and student account \nStudents are expected to make normal progress toward their degree to graduate within \nthe standard timeframe for their program of study. Under U.S. Federal Title IV \nregulations, student eligibility for federal financial aid is contingent upon enrollment in \nand successful completion of courses that are counted as credit toward their current \ndegree program. To receive the maximum amount of federal financial aid for which they \nmay be eligible, students must enroll each semester in at least 36 units that count toward \ntheir current degree level. (See separate guidance regarding integrated degree \ncompletion.) Students should consult with their designated college liaison in The HUB \nregarding billing and financial aid, particularly for early completion, longer-than-\nstandard completion, or integrated undergraduate and master\u2019s degree programs. \n \nInternational students   \nImmigration status for students in F-1 and J-1 non-immigrant status is tied to making \nnormal progress toward completing degree requirements. Therefore, F-1 and J-1 \nstudents who are considering completing their degree requirements early, anticipating \nlonger-than-standard completion, or moving from an undergraduate to a graduate \nstudent classification (integrated undergraduate-graduate study) should consult with \ntheir designated advisor in the Office of International Education (OIE) to ensure \ncompliance with immigration regulations.
