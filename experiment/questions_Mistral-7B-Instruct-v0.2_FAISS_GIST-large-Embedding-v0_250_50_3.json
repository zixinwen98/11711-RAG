You have joined a Ph.D. program that focuses on excellence, creativity, and training the next generation of research leaders. While the next few years will be a time of hard work and intense concentration, we hope that your time at the LTI will also be rewarding professionally and personally. Obtaining a Ph.D. is a long and often intense journey. A healthy work -life balance helps to keep it in perspective. Carnegie Mellon is located in Pittsburgh, a city with a rich industrial and labor heritage. In the past, it was the heart of the U.S. steel industry, a source for quality packaged foods, an important financial hub, and an early pioneer in railroads, radio, and nuclear power. This is a city where people worked hard and made things that changed the world. Today, Pittsburgh has reinvented itself as a leader in Computer Science and medicine, but it is still a place where people work hard and make things that change the world . It is also an informal city, where people don\u2019t take themselves too seriously and remember to have fun. It is home to excellent museums, competitive professional sports teams, inexpensive magic shows, and free music during the summer, with skiing and magnificent state parks nearby. Your stay here will be more rewarding if you make time for e xploring the many activities that Pittsburgh and Southwest Pennsylvania have to offer. There are significant differences between CMU's different departments and degree programs in philosophical approach, procedures, policies, and regulations. Each department issues a handbook that informs graduate students of their program requirements and procedures and ensures that students have written access to standard information. This handbook describes the policies, procedures, and requirements for the Ph.D. in Language and Information Technologies. All policies not explicitly described in this document conform to School of Computer Science (SCS) policies and university policies. For information about Carnegie Mellon requirements and policies, please see the university\u2019s handbook The Word , the Office of Graduate and Postdoctoral Affairs web page , the Office of the Dean of Students web page , and other resources contained in Appendix A of this handbook. Welcome! We hope that your time here is a life -changing experience. 1.1 Degrees Offered The Language Technologies Institute offers two Ph.D. programs and four Master degrees. \u2022 Ph.D. in Language and Information Technologies (LTI Ph.D. ) \u2022 Dual -Degree Ph.D. in Language and Information Technologies (CMU -PT Ph.D.) \u2022 Masters in Language Technologies (MLT) \u2022 Master of Science in Intelligent Information Systems (MIIS) \u2022 Master of Computational Data Science (MCDS) \u2022 Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence and Innovation (MSAII)|LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook Page 10 This handbook applies to the LTI Ph.D. The Ph.D. in Language and Information Technologies (LTI Ph.D. ) is focused on understanding and extending the state of the art in computational linguistics, natural language processing, dialogue systems, information retrieval, machine translation, speech processing, video understanding, multimodal systems, automated reasoning, and other topics related to analysis and understanding of unstructured information (e.g., machine learning, and software engineering of intelligent systems). 1.2 Department Personnel The people responsible for administering the LTI Ph.D. degree are: Jamie Callan Ph.D. Program Director Professor GHC 5419 callan@cs.cmu.edu 412-268-4525 Stacey Young Ph.D. Academic Program Manager LTI Graduate Program Manager GHC 6415 staceyy@cs.cmu.edu 412-268-2623 Mona Diab LTI Director Professor GHC 5723 mdiab@andrew.cmu.edu 412-268-3669 Joan Axelson Office Manager GHC 5405 jaxelson@andrew.cmu.edu 412-268-7517 Julie Nys Employment Processes Manger GHC 5405 jnys@andrew.cmu.edu 412-268-3515 1.3 University Policies and Expectations It is the responsibility of each member of the Carnegie Mellon community to be familiar with university policies and guidelines.

The student must apply for the Ph.D. at the usual time . However, students that are already enrolled in an LTI degree program are not required to retake GRE and TOEFL exams or to produce new transcripts from other universities. 4.1.8 Transferring Out of the Ph.D. Program The Ph.D. program doe s not prevent students from transferring to another degree program . A student who is interested in transferring out of the Ph.D. degree program should consult the handbook and Program Director of the desired degree program to learn whether transfers are permitted, and if so, how, and when to request such a transfer. 4.2 LTI Academic Policies 4.2.1 \u201cGrandfather\u201d Policy A student can graduate under the policies in effect at the time that the student entered the program; or, at the student's choice, the student can graduate under policies that are adopted after the student entered the program. If it is not realistic to follow a particular policy exactly, the department may approximate the policy as closely as possible; this situation is rare and typically arises only when a student is enrolled in the program for an extended period of time. 4.2.2 Definition of Transfer Credit vs. Course Exemption The LT I may grant transfer credit or issue an exemption for equivalent graduate courses previously completed at another institution. This decision rests with the director of the particular program. If a student is exempt from a required course due to prior cour ses or experience, the student can replace that course with an open elective. The student does not receive credit for the external course but can take any course that could normally count toward the degree in its place. If a student receives credit for pr ior coursework completed at CMU or elsewhere, the student receives that many units of credit, and the total amount of required coursework is reduced by that amount. 4.2.3 External Employment/Consulting Students funded by LTI research projects are expected to wor k primarily for those projects. Since consulting provides useful experience, students are generally permitted to consult at most one day per seven- day week, with the advisor's consent . International students must also have approval in advance from the Office of International Education (OIE) ; otherwise, they may be in violation of their visa status. See also External Internships.",

Qualifying courses: MIIS -16 students must pass 72 units (typically 6 12 -unit courses) and MIIS -21 students must complete 96 units (typically 8 12 -unit courses) in qualifying master\u2019s courses. A qualifying master\u2019s course is defined as: a. Any graduate course (600 -level or higher) offered by the Language Technologies Institute; and b. Any graduate course (600 -level or higher) from the list of approved qualifying courses (Section 3. 2.4). 2. Free elective: Students must pass 12 units (typically 1 course) in elective master\u2019s course(s). A free elective is defined as: a. A graduate course (600 -level or higher) with content relevant to the MIIS program objectives offered by the School of Computer Science ; and b. A course approved by the student's advisor and the degree Program Director. c. A student may not use the same course to satisfy both a qualifying course requirement and an elective course requirement. 3. Breadth requirements : Students must demonstrate breadth by passing one course in each of the following areas. In addition, MIIS -21 students must take two more LTI courses (24 units total) in one of the following areas of concentration: \u2022 Human language; \u2022 Machine learning; and \u2022 Language technology applications. The department maintains and publishes a list of courses that satisfy each of these requirements (Sections 3. 2.5 \u2013 3.2.7). Some c ourses used to satisfy a breadth requirement can also satisfy qualifying course requirements. A student should get approval from the director for the breadth courses , if not listed below. 4.4 Approved Qualifying Courses Any graduate course (600 -level or higher) offered by the Language Technologies Institute is a qualifying course. Any two graduate courses (600 -level or higher) offered by departments within the SCS relevant to the MIIS degree other than LTI (Machine Learning or Computer Science departments, etc.) may be counted as approved qualifying courses .|MIIS Graduate Student Handbook Page 13 4 MIIS Degree Requirements and Related Policies/Protocols 4.1 Program Options The MIIS degree is offered in two options: Option 1. Standard MIIS degree (MIIS -16) - A 16 -month track that is completed in three academic semesters (fall, spring, fall) and a summer internship. Option 2. MIIS: Advanced Study degree (MIIS -21) - A 21 -month track that is completed in four academic semesters (fall, spring, fall, spring) and a summer internship. MIIS: Advanced Study track offers in depth degree in one of the following areas of concentration: \u2022 Human Language for Language Technologies \u2022 Language Technology Application \u2022 Machine Learning for Language Technologies Part- time options are available in some cases. 4.2 Required Units for Degree Attainment To complete the Master of Science in Intelligent Information Systems, a student must satisfy three types of requirements. Curricular requirements ensure that MIIS students receive instruction in core intelligent information systems technologies while also allowing an opportunity to specialize in areas of personal interest. Practice requirements are opportunities to apply and hone new skills while building state -of-the-art systems. Grade requirements ensure that students have demonstrated a certain level of sk ill while completing degree requirements. All three types of requirements are described below. MIIS -16 students must take at least 84 units (typically 7 12 -unit courses) of qualifying and elective courses that satisfy human language, machine learning, and language technology applications breadth requirements and 66 practice units for a total of 150 units to attain the Standard MIIS degree.

The GRE Subject Test is not required, but is recommended. Our Institution Code is 2074; Department Code is 0402. English Proficiency Requirement: If you will be studying on an F-1 or J-1 visa, and English is not a native language for you (native language\u2026meaning spoken at home and from birth), an official copy of an English proficiency score report is required. The English proficiency requirement cannot be waived for any reason. Find more information under \"Test Scores\" on our FAQ page. Successful applicants will have a minimum TOEFL score of 100. Our Institution Code is 4256; the Department Code is 78. Official transcripts from each university you have attended, regardless of whether you received your degree there. Current resume. Statement of Purpose. Three letters of recommendation. For more details on these requirements, please see the SCS Doctoral Admissions page. In addition to the SCS guidelines, the LTI requires: A short (1-3 minute) video of yourself. There will be a prompt question that you will respond to. You will have three attempts. This is not a required part of the application process, but it's strongly suggested. Any outside funding you are receiving must be accompanied by an official award letter. No incomplete applications will be eligible for consideration. For specific application/admissions questions, please contact Stacey Young.|LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook Page 26 4.1.7 Transferring Into the Ph.D. Program The LTI does not allow direct transfers from its master\u2019s programs into its Ph.D. program . The student must apply for the Ph.D. at the usual time . However, students that are already enrolled in an LTI degree program are not required to retake GRE and TOEFL exams or to produce new transcripts from other universities. 4.1.8 Transferring Out of the Ph.D. Program The Ph.D. program doe s not prevent students from transferring to another degree program . A student who is interested in transferring out of the Ph.D. degree program should consult the handbook and Program Director of the desired degree program to learn whether transfers are permitted, and if so, how, and when to request such a transfer. 4.2 LTI Academic Policies 4.2.1 \u201cGrandfather\u201d Policy A student can graduate under the policies in effect at the time that the student entered the program; or, at the student's choice, the student can graduate under policies that are adopted after the student entered the program. If it is not realistic to follow a particular policy exactly, the department may approximate the policy as closely as possible; this situation is rare and typically arises only when a student is enrolled in the program for an extended period of time. 4.2.2 Definition of Transfer Credit vs. Course Exemption The LT I may grant transfer credit or issue an exemption for equivalent graduate courses previously completed at another institution. This decision rests with the director of the particular program. If a student is exempt from a required course due to prior cour ses or experience, the student can replace that course with an open elective. The student does not receive credit for the external course but can take any course that could normally count toward the degree in its place. If a student receives credit for pr ior coursework completed at CMU or elsewhere, the student receives that many units of credit, and the total amount of required coursework is reduced by that amount. 4.2.3 External Employment/Consulting Students funded by LTI research projects are expected to wor k primarily for those projects. Since consulting provides useful experience, students are generally permitted to consult at most one day per seven- day week, with the advisor's consent . International students must also have approval in advance from the Office of International Education (OIE) ; otherwise, they may be in violation of their visa status.

Turing Award for their work in artificial intelligence. (As of 2014, 12 CMU alumni or faculty have been awarded Turings, sometimes considered the Nobel Prize of computing.) Three years later, Simon received the Nobel Prize in Economics for his work on decision-making theory. As the 1970s progressed, Newell became interested in human-computer interaction, and began a long relationship with Xerox\u2019s Palo Alto Research Center, or PARC, which released the Xerox Alto in 1973. Considered a forerunner to many of the computing environments that followed, Alto featured a graphical-user interface and was among the first commercially available workstations controlled with a mouse. Inspired by Alto, Reddy launched a drive for development of CMU\u2019s own \u201cthree-M\u201d machine\u2014a personal workstation with a megabyte of memory, a megapixel display and at least one million instructions per second of processing power.\n",

Waibel Title: Convoifilter: A case study of doing cocktail party speech recognition Publication year: 2023 Coauthors: T. Nguyen, A. Waibel Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end model designed to improve automatic speech recognition (ASR) for a particular speaker in a crowded, noisy environment. The model utilizes a single-channel speech enhancement module that isolates the speaker's voice from background noise (ConVoiFilter) and an ASR module. The model can decrease ASR's word error rate (WER) from 80% to 26.4% through this approach. Typically, these two components are adjusted independently due to variations in data requirements. However, speech enhancement can create anomalies that decrease ASR efficiency. By implementing a joint fine-tuning strategy, the model can reduce the WER from 26.4% in separate tuning to 14.5% in joint tuning. We openly share our pre-trained model to foster further research hf.co/nguyenvulebinh/voice-filter.|23.

Robinson, Perez Ogayo, David R. Mortensen, Graham Neubig Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) implicitly learn to perform a range of language tasks, including machine translation (MT). Previous studies explore aspects of LLMs\u2019 MT capabilities. However, there exist a wide variety of languages for which recent LLM MT performance has never before been evaluated. Without published experimental evidence on the matter, it is difficult for speakers of the world\u2019s diverse languages to know how and whether they can use LLMs for their languages. We present the first experimental evidence for an expansive set of 204 languages, along with MT cost analysis, using the FLORES-200 benchmark. Trends reveal that GPT models approach or exceed traditional MT model performance for some high-resource languages (HRLs) but consistently lag for low-resource languages (LRLs), under-performing traditional MT for 84.1% of languages we covered. Our analysis reveals that a language\u2019s resource level is the most important feature in determining ChatGPT\u2019s relative ability to translate it, and suggests that ChatGPT is especially disadvantaged for LRLs and African languages.",

Here are 25 great ideas from CMU computer scientists to think about as we celebrate the birthday of the School of Computer Science.1. Artificial intelligence, 1955-56\u00a0Can you write a working computer program without a computer? Herb Simon (H\u201990), at left, Allen Newell (IA\u201957), at right, and Cliff Shaw did. The team created the first artificial intelligence program, Logic Theorist, which could solve logic puzzles in the same way that a human might solve them. Newell demonstrated that it worked by writing the instructions on 3-by-5 index cards that were manipulated on the kitchen table by Newell, his wife, and a group of Carnegie Tech grad students.|15. Model checking, 1994CMU professor Edmund Clarke had long stressed the importance of verifying computer hardware and software through a formal problem-solving technique called \u201cmodel checking.\u201d In 1994, his arguments gained new weight with the discovery that Intel\u2019s amazing new Pentium chip made errors on certain math problems. Clarke would go on to receive the Turing Award for his role in the development of model checking.",
