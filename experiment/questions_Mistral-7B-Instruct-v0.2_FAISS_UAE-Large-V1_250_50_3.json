Students are expected to attend the LTI's Orientation (\u201cImmigration \nCourse ,\u201d or IC) lectures, in which faculty describe their interests and areas of expertise, and to \nbe proactive about meeting individually with potential advisors. After meeting with several \npotential advisors, each student will be asked to indicate a firs t, second, and third choice for \nadvisor. Meanwhile, the potential advisors determine how many new students they can take, \nand indicate their preferences. Finally, the  entire LTI faculty meets as a \u201c Marriage Committee \u201d \nto determine the best set of matches.  \nSome entering MLT students are prefunded, meaning they have received and accepted a funding letter from a faculty member before the Marriage Process. (Even students who are prefunded must attend the research talks, to become acquainted with the LTI\u2019s rese arch \nprojects.) Even self -supporting MLT students are expected to perform research with a faculty \nadvisor, since research experience is an important part of our graduate programs. Until a student finds a specific advisor, the chair of the LTI graduate prog rams serves as the advisor.  \nHow to change advisors:  The initial advisor selection should be made carefully. However, it is \npossible to change advisors. To do so, the student should find another faculty member willing \nto serve as an advisor, and then make a  request to the Program Director to switch advisors. The \nLTI follows the long -standing SCS policy that both the new and old advisors need to agree to the \nchange; typically, this is not a problem ( assuming the new advisor has agreed in advance, as \ndescribed  here ). It is to the student's advantage to avoid switching advisors, especially late in \ntheir graduate studies, because forging a strong student- advisor relationship takes time.  \n4.3 Optional Masters\u2019  Thesis  \nMLT students may optionally  elect to complete a Mast ers\u2019 Thesis; it is not  required. Students \nwho intend to apply for the PhD program should consider the MLT Thesis as one of several \nways to demonstrate their research potential.

Curricular requirements ensure that MIIS students receive \ninstruction in core intelligent information systems technologies while also allowing an \nopportunity to specialize in areas of personal interest.  Practice requirements are opportunities \nto apply and hone new skills while building state -of-the-art systems. Grade  requirements ensure \nthat students have demonstrated a certain level of sk ill while completing degree requirements. \nAll three types of requirements are described below.  \nMIIS -16 students must take at least 84 units (typically 7 12 -unit courses) of qualifying and \nelective courses that satisfy human language, machine learning, and language technology \napplications breadth requirements and 66 practice units for a total of 150 units to attain the \nStandard MIIS degree.  \nMIIS -21 students must take at least 108 units (typically 9 12 -unit courses) of qualifying and \nelective courses and 66 practice units to satisfy their degree requirements, making it a total of 174 units to attain the MIIS: Advanced Study degree. \n4.3 Core Requirements  | \nMaster of Science in Intelligent Information Systems (MIIS) Requirements: \n\nThe Intelligent Information Systems degree offers students the flexibility to create their own course of study in consultation with their advisor. \n\nMIIS students gain three types of practical experience: software development supervised by their advisor (24 units equivalent to two courses); a summer internship (which can be waived for students that have sufficient prior professional experience); and a capstone project executed in a group of peers (42 units equivalent to three 12-unit courses and one 6-unit course). This combination is proven to help IIS students to broaden their skills quickly. The MIIS degree is offered in two options:\n\nOption 1. Standard MIIS degree (MIIS-16) - A 16-month track that is completed in three academic semesters (fall, spring, fall) and a summer internship.  \n\nOption 2.

Typical errors include acronyms, named entities and domain-specific special words for which little or no data is available. To address the problem of recognizing these words, we propose an self-supervised continual learning approach. Given the audio of a lecture talk with corresponding slides, we bias the model towards decoding new words from the slides by using a memory-enhanced ASR model from previous work. Then, we perform inference on the talk, collecting utterances that contain detected new words into an adaptation dataset. Continual learning is then performed on this set by adapting low-rank matrix weights added to each weight matrix of the model. The whole procedure is iterated for many talks. We show that with this approach, we obtain increasing performance on the new words when they occur more frequently (more than 80% recall) while preserving the general performance of the model.|Author: A. Waibel Title: Convoifilter: A case study of doing cocktail party speech recognition Publication year: 2023 Coauthors: T. Nguyen, A. Waibel Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end model designed to improve automatic speech recognition (ASR) for a particular speaker in a crowded, noisy environment. The model utilizes a single-channel speech enhancement module that isolates the speaker's voice from background noise (ConVoiFilter) and an ASR module. The model can decrease ASR's word error rate (WER) from 80% to 26.4% through this approach. Typically, these two components are adjusted independently due to variations in data requirements. However, speech enhancement can create anomalies that decrease ASR efficiency. By implementing a joint fine-tuning strategy, the model can reduce the WER from 26.4% in separate tuning to 14.5% in joint tuning.

Robinson, Perez Ogayo, David R. Mortensen, Graham Neubig Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) implicitly learn to perform a range of language tasks, including machine translation (MT). Previous studies explore aspects of LLMs\u2019 MT capabilities. However, there exist a wide variety of languages for which recent LLM MT performance has never before been evaluated. Without published experimental evidence on the matter, it is difficult for speakers of the world\u2019s diverse languages to know how and whether they can use LLMs for their languages. We present the first experimental evidence for an expansive set of 204 languages, along with MT cost analysis, using the FLORES-200 benchmark. Trends reveal that GPT models approach or exceed traditional MT model performance for some high-resource languages (HRLs) but consistently lag for low-resource languages (LRLs), under-performing traditional MT for 84.1% of languages we covered. Our analysis reveals that a language\u2019s resource level is the most important feature in determining ChatGPT\u2019s relative ability to translate it, and suggests that ChatGPT is especially disadvantaged for LRLs and African languages.",

Chiu, Daniel Fried Abstract: When a model is trying to gather information in an interactive setting, it benefits from asking informative questions. However, in the case of a grounded multi-turn image identification task, previous studies have been constrained to polar yes/no questions, limiting how much information the model can gain in a single turn. We present an approach that formulates more informative, open-ended questions. In doing so, we discover that off-the-shelf visual question answering (VQA) models often make presupposition errors, which standard information gain question selection methods fail to account for. To address this issue, we propose a method that can incorporate presupposition handling into both question selection and belief updates. Specifically, we use a two-stage process, where the model first filters out images which are irrelevant to a given question, then updates its beliefs about which image the user intends. Through self-play and human evaluations, we show that our method is successful in asking informative open-ended questions, increasing accuracy over the past state-of-the-art by 14%, while resulting in 48% more efficient games in human evaluations.",

Publication year: 2023 Coauthors: A. Luccioni, Yacine Jernite, Emma Strubell Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in the popularity of commercial AI products based on generative, multi-purpose AI systems promising a unified approach to building machine learning (ML) models into technology. However, this ambition of\"generality\"comes at a steep cost to the environment, given the amount of energy these systems require and the amount of carbon that they emit. In this work, we propose the first systematic comparison of the ongoing inference cost of various categories of ML systems, covering both task-specific (i.e. finetuned models that carry out a single task) and `general-purpose' models, (i.e. those trained for multiple tasks). We measure deployment cost as the amount of energy and carbon required to perform 1,000 inferences on representative benchmark dataset using these models. We find that multi-purpose, generative architectures are orders of magnitude more expensive than task-specific systems for a variety of tasks, even when controlling for the number of model parameters. We conclude with a discussion around the current trend of deploying multi-purpose generative ML systems, and caution that their utility should be more intentionally weighed against increased costs in terms of energy and emissions. All the data from our study can be accessed via an interactive demo to carry out further exploration and analysis.",

The prompts used by companies to guide their models are often treated as secrets, to be hidden from the user making the query. They have even been treated as commodities to be bought and sold. However, anecdotal reports have shown adversarial users employing prompt extraction attacks to recover these prompts. In this paper, we present a framework for systematically measuring the effectiveness of these attacks. In experiments with 3 different sources of prompts and 11 underlying large language models, we find that simple text-based attacks can in fact reveal prompts with high probability. Our framework determines with high precision whether an extracted prompt is the actual secret prompt, rather than a model hallucination. Prompt extraction experiments on real systems such as Bing Chat and ChatGPT suggest that system prompts can be revealed by an adversary despite existing defenses in place.|Author: A. Waibel Title: AdapITN: A Fast, Reliable, and Dynamic Adaptive Inverse Text Normalization Publication year: 2023 Coauthors: T. Nguyen, Le Duc Minh Nhat, Quang Minh Nguyen, Quoc Truong Do, C. Luong, A. Waibel Abstract: Inverse text normalization (ITN) is the task that transforms text in spoken-form into written-form. While automatic speech recognition (ASR) produces text in spoken-form, human and natural language understanding systems prefer to consume text in written-form. ITN generally deals with semiotic phrases (e.g., numbers, date, time). However, lack of studies to deal with phonetization phrases, which is ASR\u2019s output when it handles unseen data (e.g., foreign-named entities, domain names), although these exist in the same form in the spoken-form text. The reason is that phonetization phrases are infinite patterns and language-dependent. In this study, we introduce a novel end2end model that can handle both semiotic phrases (SEP) and phonetization phrases (PHP), named AdapITN. We call it \"Adap\" because it allows for handling unseen PHP. The model performs only when necessary by providing a mechanism to narrow normalized regions and external query knowledge, reducing the runtime significantly.",

Salakhutdinov, A. Azaria, Tom M. Mitchell, Yuan-Fang Li Abstract: Open-world survival games pose significant challenges for AI algorithms due to their multi-tasking, deep exploration, and goal prioritization requirements. Despite reinforcement learning (RL) being popular for solving games, its high sample complexity limits its effectiveness in complex open-world games like Crafter or Minecraft. We propose a novel approach, SPRING, to read the game's original academic paper and use the knowledge learned to reason and play the game through a large language model (LLM). Prompted with the LaTeX source as game context and a description of the agent's current observation, our SPRING framework employs a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with game-related questions as nodes and dependencies as edges. We identify the optimal action to take in the environment by traversing the DAG and calculating LLM responses for each node in topological order, with the LLM's answer to final node directly translating to environment actions. In our experiments, we study the quality of in-context\"reasoning\"induced by different forms of prompts under the setting of the Crafter open-world environment. Our experiments suggest that LLMs, when prompted with consistent chain-of-thought, have great potential in completing sophisticated high-level trajectories. Quantitatively, SPRING with GPT-4 outperforms all state-of-the-art RL baselines, trained for 1M steps, without any training. Finally, we show the potential of games as a test bed for LLMs.|Author: Graham Neubig Title: WebArena: A Realistic Web Environment for Building Autonomous Agents Publication year: 2023 Coauthors: Shuyan Zhou, Frank F. Xu, Hao Zhu, Xuhui Zhou, Robert Lo, Abishek Sridhar, Xianyi Cheng, Yonatan Bisk, Daniel Fried, Uri Alon, Graham Neubig Abstract: With advances in generative AI, there is now potential for autonomous agents to manage daily tasks via natural language commands. However, current agents are primarily created and tested in simplified synthetic environments, leading to a disconnect with real-world scenarios. In this paper, we build an environment for language-guided agents that is highly realistic and reproducible. Specifically, we focus on agents that perform tasks on the web, and create an environment with fully functional websites from four common domains: e-commerce, social forum discussions, collaborative software development, and content management. Our environment is enriched with tools (e.g., a map) and external knowledge bases (e.g., user manuals) to encourage human-like task-solving. Building upon our environment, we release a set of benchmark tasks focusing on evaluating the functional correctness of task completions. The tasks in our benchmark are diverse, long-horizon, and designed to emulate tasks that humans routinely perform on the internet. We experiment with several baseline agents, integrating recent techniques such as reasoning before acting. The results demonstrate that solving complex tasks is challenging: our best GPT-4-based agent only achieves an end-to-end task success rate of 14.41%, significantly lower than the human performance of 78.24%. These results highlight the need for further development of robust agents, that current state-of-the-art large language models are far from perfect performance in these real-life tasks, and that WebArena can be used to measure such progress.",

Salakhutdinov, A. Azaria, Tom M. Mitchell, Yuan-Fang Li Abstract: Open-world survival games pose significant challenges for AI algorithms due to their multi-tasking, deep exploration, and goal prioritization requirements. Despite reinforcement learning (RL) being popular for solving games, its high sample complexity limits its effectiveness in complex open-world games like Crafter or Minecraft. We propose a novel approach, SPRING, to read the game's original academic paper and use the knowledge learned to reason and play the game through a large language model (LLM). Prompted with the LaTeX source as game context and a description of the agent's current observation, our SPRING framework employs a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with game-related questions as nodes and dependencies as edges. We identify the optimal action to take in the environment by traversing the DAG and calculating LLM responses for each node in topological order, with the LLM's answer to final node directly translating to environment actions. In our experiments, we study the quality of in-context\"reasoning\"induced by different forms of prompts under the setting of the Crafter open-world environment. Our experiments suggest that LLMs, when prompted with consistent chain-of-thought, have great potential in completing sophisticated high-level trajectories. Quantitatively, SPRING with GPT-4 outperforms all state-of-the-art RL baselines, trained for 1M steps, without any training. Finally, we show the potential of games as a test bed for LLMs.|Author: Mona T. Diab Title: OPT-R: Exploring the Role of Explanations in Finetuning and Prompting for Reasoning Skills of Large Language Models Publication year: 2023 Coauthors: Badr AlKhamissi, Siddharth Verma, Ping Yu, Zhijing Jin, Asli Celikyilmaz, Mona T. Diab Abstract: We conduct a thorough investigation into the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing specifically on the Open Pretrained Transformers (OPT) models as a representative of such models. Our study entails finetuning three different sizes of OPT on a carefully curated reasoning corpus, resulting in two sets of finetuned models: OPT-R, finetuned without explanations, and OPT-RE, finetuned with explanations. We then evaluate all models on 57 out-of-domain tasks drawn from the Super-NaturalInstructions benchmark, covering 26 distinct reasoning skills, utilizing three prompting techniques. Through a comprehensive grid of 27 configurations and 6,156 test evaluations, we investigate the dimensions of finetuning, prompting, and scale to understand the role of explanations on different reasoning skills. Our findings reveal that having explanations in the fewshot exemplar has no significant impact on the model\u2019s performance when the model is finetuned, while positively affecting the non-finetuned counterpart. Moreover, we observe a slight yet consistent increase in classification accuracy as we incorporate explanations during prompting and finetuning, respectively. Finally, we offer insights on which reasoning skills benefit the most from incorporating explanations during finetuning and prompting, such as Numerical (+20.4%) and Analogical (+13.9%) reasoning, as well as skills that exhibit negligible or negative effects.",

They can present harder or easier problems based on the student's performance, making the learning experience more personalized and effective. Additionally, cognitive tutors are not limited to teaching one subject at a time, and they can be used to teach various subjects such as algebra to large numbers of students every year. In contrast, traditional games and drills may not provide this level of customization and flexibility.

In the past, gesture generation models assumed that data for each speaker is available all at once, and in large amounts. However in practical scenarios, speaker data comes sequentially and in small amounts as the agent personalizes with more speakers, akin to a continual learning paradigm. While more recent works have shown progress in adapting to low-resource data, they catastrophically forget the gesture styles of initial speakers they were trained on. Also, prior generative continual learning works are not multimodal, making this space less studied. In this paper, we explore this new paradigm and propose C-DiffGAN: an approach that continually learns new speaker gesture styles with only a few minutes of per-speaker data, while retaining previously learnt styles. Inspired by prior continual learning works, C-DiffGAN encourages knowledge retention by 1) generating reminiscences of previous low-resource speaker data, then 2) crossmodally aligning to them to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. We quantitatively demonstrate improved performance and reduced forgetting over strong baselines through standard continual learning measures, reinforced by a qualitative user study that shows that our method produces more natural, style-preserving gestures.

Recent research has hinted in the affirmative, finding that brain signals can be effectively predicted using the internal representations of language models (LMs). Although such results are thought to reflect shared computational principles between LMs and human brains, there are also clear differences in how LMs and humans represent and use language. In this work, we systematically explore the divergences between human and machine language processing by examining the differences between LM representations and human brain responses to language as measured by Magnetoencephalography (MEG) across two datasets in which subjects read and listened to narrative stories. Using a data-driven approach, we identify two domains that are not captured well by LMs: social/emotional intelligence and physical commonsense. We then validate these domains with human behavioral experiments and show that fine-tuning LMs on these domains can improve their alignment with human brain responses.",

We present the first experimental evidence for an expansive set of 204 languages, along with MT cost analysis, using the FLORES-200 benchmark.

Trends reveal that GPT models approach or exceed traditional MT model performance for some high-resource languages (HRLs) but consistently lag for low-resource languages (LRLs), under-performing traditional MT for 84.1% of languages we covered. Our analysis reveals that a language\u2019s resource level is the most important feature in determining ChatGPT\u2019s relative ability to translate it, and suggests that ChatGPT is especially disadvantaged for LRLs and African languages.",

Borenstein didn\u2019t take the offer, but he did like Jobs\u2019 idea about attaching documents to email.

        "retrieved_doc": "LTI Ph.D.  Graduate Student Handbook  Page 26 \n 4.1.7 Transferring Into the Ph.D.  Program  \nThe LTI does not allow direct transfers from its master\u2019s programs into its Ph.D.  program . The \nstudent must apply for the Ph.D.  at the usual time . However, students that are already enrolled in \nan LTI degree program are not required to retake GRE and TOEFL exams or to produce new \ntranscripts from other universities.  \n4.1.8 Transferring Out of the Ph.D.  Program  \nThe Ph.D.  program doe s not prevent students from transferring to another degree program . A \nstudent who is interested in transferring out of the Ph.D.  degree program should consult the \nhandbook and Program Director of the desired degree program to learn whether transfers are permitted, and if so, how, and when to request such a transfer.  \n4.2 LTI Academic Policies  \n4.2.1 \u201cGrandfather\u201d Policy  \nA student can graduate under the policies in effect at the time that the student entered the \nprogram; or, at the student's choice, the student can graduate under policies that are adopted after \nthe student entered the program. If it is not realistic to follow a particular policy  exactly, the \ndepartment may approximate the policy as closely as possible; this situation is rare and typically arises only when a student is enrolled in the program for an extended period of time.  \n4.2.2 Definition of Transfer Credit  vs. Course Exemption  \nThe LT I may grant transfer credit  or issue an exemption for equivalent graduate courses previously \ncompleted at another institution. This decision rests with the director  of the particular program.  \nIf a student is exempt  from a required course due to prior cour ses or experience, the student can \nreplace that course with an open elective. The student does not receive credit for the external course but  can take any course that could normally count toward the degree in its place.  \nIf a student receives credit  for pr ior coursework completed at CMU or elsewhere, the student \nreceives that many units of credit, and the total amount of required coursework is reduced by that \namount.  \n4.2.3 External Employment/Consulting  \nStudents funded by LTI research projects are expected to wor k primarily for those projects. Since \nconsulting provides useful experience, students are generally permitted to consult at most one \nday per seven- day week, with the advisor's consent . International students must also have \napproval in advance from the Office of International Education (OIE) ; otherwise, they may be in \nviolation of their visa status. See also External Internships.  |MLT Graduate Student Handbook  Page 15 \n How and when the advisor is selected: the Marriage Process:  Advisors are selected during the \nfirst month of the program. Students are expected to attend the LTI's Orientation (\u201cImmigration \nCourse ,\u201d or IC) lectures, in which faculty describe their interests and areas of expertise, and to \nbe proactive about meeting individually with potential advisors. After meeting with several \npotential advisors, each student will be asked to indicate a firs t, second, and third choice for \nadvisor. Meanwhile, the potential advisors determine how many new students they can take, \nand indicate their preferences. Finally, the  entire LTI faculty meets as a \u201c Marriage Committee \u201d \nto determine the best set of matches.  \nSome entering MLT students are prefunded, meaning they have received and accepted a funding letter from a faculty member before the Marriage Process. (Even students who are prefunded must attend the research talks, to become acquainted with the LTI\u2019s rese arch \nprojects.) Even self -supporting MLT students are expected to perform research with a faculty \nadvisor, since research experience is an important part of our graduate programs. Until a student finds a specific advisor, the chair of the LTI graduate prog rams serves as the advisor.  \nHow to change advisors:  The initial advisor selection should be made carefully. However, it is \npossible to change advisors. To do so, the student should find another faculty member willing \nto serve as an advisor, and then make a  request to the Program Director to switch advisors. The \nLTI follows the long -standing SCS policy that both the new and old advisors need to agree to the \nchange; typically, this is not a problem ( assuming the new advisor has agreed in advance, as \ndescribed  here ). It is to the student's advantage to avoid switching advisors, especially late in \ntheir graduate studies, because forging a strong student- advisor relationship takes time.  \n4.3 Optional Masters\u2019  Thesis  \nMLT students may optionally  elect to complete a Mast ers\u2019 Thesis; it is not  required. Students \nwho intend to apply for the PhD program should consider the MLT Thesis as one of several \nways to demonstrate their research potential. Other possibilities include innovative research in a research project or class project work.  \nThe MLT Thesis must be completed according to the following guidelines. Note in particular the October 31 proposal deadline!  \n\u2022 There are two course components required for students who elect to complete the M.S. Thesis: 11 -928 \u2013 Masters \u2019 Thesis I (with the chosen thesis advisor, typically for 12 units, \ntypically in the Fall of their second year) and 11 -929 \u2013 Masters \u2019 Thesis II in the following \nSpring.  \n\u2022 Each of these two courses counts towards 6 units of MLT -level LTI course credit; if the \nstudent goes on to an LTI PhD, the second course (11 -929) counts towards one PhD lab \nrequirement.   \n\u2022 The MLT thesis may focus on either a significant research result or a significant implementation of a new technology. The student should work with their adv isor to \ndefine an interesting but bounded thesis research project.

Upon completion of the graduate program degree requirements, the degree will be certified by the student\u2019s academic program in the semester in which the student completes the \nrequirements.  \nEarly Completion  \nThe Ph.D. is granted when  all degree requirements are satisfied. Some students complete the \nprogram in fewer than five years.  |LTI Ph.D.  Graduate Student Handbook  Page 25 \n Note that self- funded Ph.D.  students (e.g., those registered for five units while on semester \ninterns hip) are not permitted to receive a partial stipend for the semester of their internship, while \nfull- time LTI -sponsored students are eligible for a partial stipend.  \nAll students are caution ed to be aware of potential intellectual property (IP) problems with \ninternships, and to review any IP agreements with their advisors before signing them. It is possible \nto lose ownership of your ideas.  \nIf the student is to receive academic credit for the internship,  it must have deliverables from the \nstudent commensurate with the number of units,  they are taking. This can be in the form of \ninterim and final reports on the experience, presentations in the following semester regarding the experience, assessments of their experience as it relates to their course of study, etc.  \n4.1.3 Maximum Courseload  \nPh.D.  students are permitted to register for a maximum of 54  units of coursework per semester.  \n4.1.4 Pass/Fail Grades  \nPass/fail grades are not permitted for courses used to satisfy a degree requirement.  \nGraduate students who are required to take additional undergraduate courses to build up the core \nfoundations of computer science may not elect the pass/fail option for th ese courses.  \n4.1.5 Transfer Credit  \nAn equivalent graduate course previously completed at another institution may be permitted to \nsatisfy one of the Ph.D.  course requirements. The decision on whether a course may be transferred \nis made by the Ph.D.  Program Direct or.  \nTypically,  the student will provide the Program Director with the syllabus of the external course, \nand the Program Director will use that and the student\u2019s transcript to make the decision.  \nSee the section on \u201cDefinition of transfer credit versus cour se exemption .\u201d \nA student may not receive transfer credit for more than four courses.  \n4.1.6 Residency Requirements  \nThe university requires Ph.D. s to spend at least one year of residency at Carnegie Mellon.  \nThe SCS requires that all Ph.D.  students must take at Carnegie Mellon a minimum of 48  units of \nthe total coursework required by their respective programs.
