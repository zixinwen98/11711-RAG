Students are expected to attend the LTI's Orientation (\u201cImmigration Course ,\u201d or IC) lectures, in which faculty describe their interests and areas of expertise, and to be proactive about meeting individually with potential advisors. After meeting with several potential advisors, each student will be asked to indicate a firs t, second, and third choice for advisor. Meanwhile, the potential advisors determine how many new students they can take, and indicate their preferences. Finally, the entire LTI faculty meets as a \u201c Marriage Committee \u201d to determine the best set of matches. Some entering MLT students are prefunded, meaning they have received and accepted a funding letter from a faculty member before the Marriage Process. (Even students who are prefunded must attend the research talks, to become acquainted with the LTI\u2019s rese arch projects.) Even self -supporting MLT students are expected to perform research with a faculty advisor, since research experience is an important part of our graduate programs. Until a student finds a specific advisor, the chair of the LTI graduate prog rams serves as the advisor. How to change advisors: The initial advisor selection should be made carefully. However, it is possible to change advisors. To do so, the student should find another faculty member willing to serve as an advisor, and then make a request to the Program Director to switch advisors. The LTI follows the long -standing SCS policy that both the new and old advisors need to agree to the change; typically, this is not a problem ( assuming the new advisor has agreed in advance, as described here ). It is to the student's advantage to avoid switching advisors, especially late in their graduate studies, because forging a strong student- advisor relationship takes time. 4.3 Optional Masters\u2019 Thesis MLT students may optionally elect to complete a Mast ers\u2019 Thesis; it is not required. Students who intend to apply for the PhD program should consider the MLT Thesis as one of several ways to demonstrate their research potential. Other possibilities include innovative research in a research project or class project work. The MLT Thesis must be completed according to the following guidelines. Note in particular the October 31 proposal deadline! \u2022 There are two course components required for students who elect to complete the M.S. Thesis: 11 -928 \u2013 Masters \u2019 Thesis I (with the chosen thesis advisor, typically for 12 units, typically in the Fall of their second year) and 11 -929 \u2013 Masters \u2019 Thesis II in the following Spring. \u2022 Each of these two courses counts towards 6 units of MLT -level LTI course credit; if the student goes on to an LTI PhD, the second course (11 -929) counts towards one PhD lab requirement. \u2022 The MLT thesis may focus on either a significant research result or a significant implementation of a new technology. The student should work with their adv isor to define an interesting but bounded thesis research project. The MLT thesis culminates in",

In addition, MIIS -21 students must take two more LTI courses (24 units total) in one of the following areas of concentration: \u2022 Human language; \u2022 Machine learning; and \u2022 Language technology applications. The department maintains and publishes a list of courses that satisfy each of these requirements (Sections 3. 2.5 \u2013 3.2.7). Some c ourses used to satisfy a breadth requirement can also satisfy qualifying course requirements. A student should get approval from the director for the breadth courses , if not listed below. 4.4 Approved Qualifying Courses Any graduate course (600 -level or higher) offered by the Language Technologies Institute is a qualifying course. Any two graduate courses (600 -level or higher) offered by departments within the SCS relevant to the MIIS degree other than LTI (Machine Learning or Computer Science departments, etc.) may be counted as approved qualifying courses .|MIIS Graduate Student Handbook Page 13 4 MIIS Degree Requirements and Related Policies/Protocols 4.1 Program Options The MIIS degree is offered in two options: Option 1. Standard MIIS degree (MIIS -16) - A 16 -month track that is completed in three academic semesters (fall, spring, fall) and a summer internship. Option 2. MIIS: Advanced Study degree (MIIS -21) - A 21 -month track that is completed in four academic semesters (fall, spring, fall, spring) and a summer internship. MIIS: Advanced Study track offers in depth degree in one of the following areas of concentration: \u2022 Human Language for Language Technologies \u2022 Language Technology Application \u2022 Machine Learning for Language Technologies Part- time options are available in some cases. 4.2 Required Units for Degree Attainment To complete the Master of Science in Intelligent Information Systems, a student must satisfy three types of requirements. Curricular requirements ensure that MIIS students receive instruction in core intelligent information systems technologies while also allowing an opportunity to specialize in areas of personal interest. Practice requirements are opportunities to apply and hone new skills while building state -of-the-art systems. Grade requirements ensure that students have demonstrated a certain level of sk ill while completing degree requirements. All three types of requirements are described below. MIIS -16 students must take at least 84 units (typically 7 12 -unit courses) of qualifying and elective courses that satisfy human language, machine learning, and language technology applications breadth requirements and 66 practice units for a total of 150 units to attain the Standard MIIS degree.

Typical errors include acronyms, named entities and domain-specific special words for which little or no data is available. To address the problem of recognizing these words, we propose an self-supervised continual learning approach. Given the audio of a lecture talk with corresponding slides, we bias the model towards decoding new words from the slides by using a memory-enhanced ASR model from previous work. Then, we perform inference on the talk, collecting utterances that contain detected new words into an adaptation dataset. Continual learning is then performed on this set by adapting low-rank matrix weights added to each weight matrix of the model. The whole procedure is iterated for many talks. We show that with this approach, we obtain increasing performance on the new words when they occur more frequently (more than 80% recall) while preserving the general performance of the model.|Author: A. Waibel Title: Convoifilter: A case study of doing cocktail party speech recognition Publication year: 2023 Coauthors: T. Nguyen, A. Waibel Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end model designed to improve automatic speech recognition (ASR) for a particular speaker in a crowded, noisy environment. The model utilizes a single-channel speech enhancement module that isolates the speaker's voice from background noise (ConVoiFilter) and an ASR module. The model can decrease ASR's word error rate (WER) from 80% to 26.4% through this approach. Typically, these two components are adjusted independently due to variations in data requirements. However, speech enhancement can create anomalies that decrease ASR efficiency. By implementing a joint fine-tuning strategy, the model can reduce the WER from 26.4% in separate tuning to 14.5% in joint tuning.

This paper assesses the effectiveness of both language-agnostic and language-aware paradigms for multilingual pre-trained transformer models in a bi-encoder-based dense passage retriever (DPR), concluding that the language-agnostic approach is superior. Additionally, the study investigates the impact of query rewriting techniques using large language models, such as ChatGPT, on multilingual, document-grounded question-answering systems. The experiments conducted demonstrate that, for the examples examined, query rewriting does not enhance performance compared to the original queries. This failure is due to topic switching in final dialogue turns and irrelevant topics being considered for query rewriting.|9.

Robinson, Perez Ogayo, David R. Mortensen, Graham Neubig Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) implicitly learn to perform a range of language tasks, including machine translation (MT). Previous studies explore aspects of LLMs\u2019 MT capabilities. However, there exist a wide variety of languages for which recent LLM MT performance has never before been evaluated. Without published experimental evidence on the matter, it is difficult for speakers of the world\u2019s diverse languages to know how and whether they can use LLMs for their languages. We present the first experimental evidence for an expansive set of 204 languages, along with MT cost analysis, using the FLORES-200 benchmark. Trends reveal that GPT models approach or exceed traditional MT model performance for some high-resource languages (HRLs) but consistently lag for low-resource languages (LRLs), under-performing traditional MT for 84.1% of languages we covered. Our analysis reveals that a language\u2019s resource level is the most important feature in determining ChatGPT\u2019s relative ability to translate it, and suggests that ChatGPT is especially disadvantaged for LRLs and African languages.",

Chiu, Daniel Fried Abstract: When a model is trying to gather information in an interactive setting, it benefits from asking informative questions. However, in the case of a grounded multi-turn image identification task, previous studies have been constrained to polar yes/no questions, limiting how much information the model can gain in a single turn. We present an approach that formulates more informative, open-ended questions. In doing so, we discover that off-the-shelf visual question answering (VQA) models often make presupposition errors, which standard information gain question selection methods fail to account for. To address this issue, we propose a method that can incorporate presupposition handling into both question selection and belief updates. Specifically, we use a two-stage process, where the model first filters out images which are irrelevant to a given question, then updates its beliefs about which image the user intends. Through self-play and human evaluations, we show that our method is successful in asking informative open-ended questions, increasing accuracy over the past state-of-the-art by 14%, while resulting in 48% more efficient games in human evaluations.",
