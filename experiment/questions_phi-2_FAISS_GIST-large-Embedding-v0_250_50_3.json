You have joined a Ph.D. program that focuses on excellence, creativity, and training the next generation of research leaders. While the next few years will be a time of hard work and intense concentration, we hope that your time at the LTI will also be rewarding professionally and personally. Obtaining a Ph.D. is a long and often intense journey. A healthy work-life balance helps to keep it in perspective. Carnegie Mellon is located in Pittsburgh, a city with a rich industrial and labor heritage. In the past, it was the heart of the U.S. steel industry, a source for quality packaged foods, an important financial hub, and an early pioneer in railroads, radio, and nuclear power. This is a city where people worked hard and made things that changed the world. Today, Pittsburgh has reinvented itself as a leader in Computer Science and medicine, but it is still a place where people work hard and make things that change the world . It is also an informal city, where people don\u2019t take themselves too seriously and remember to have fun. It is home to excellent museums, competitive professional sports teams, inexpensive magic shows, and free music during the summer, with skiing and magnificent state parks nearby. Your stay here will be more rewarding if you make time for e xploring the many activities that Pittsburgh and Southwest Pennsylvania have to offer. There are significant differences between CMU's different departments and degree programs in philosophical approach, procedures, policies, and regulations. Each department issues a handbook that informs graduate students of their program requirements and procedures and ensures that students have written access to standard information. This handbook describes the policies, procedures, and requirements for the Ph.D. in Language and Information Technologies. All policies not explicitly described in this document conform to School of Computer Science (SCS) policies and university policies. For information about Carnegie Mellon requirements and policies, please see the university\u2019s handbook The Word , the Office of Graduate and Postdoctoral Affairs web page , the Office of the Dean of Students web page , and other resources contained in Appendix A of this handbook. Welcome! We hope that your time here is a life-changing experience. 1.1 Degrees Offered The Language Technologies Institute offers two Ph.D. programs and four Master degrees. \u2022 Ph.D. in Language and Information Technologies (LTI Ph.D. ) \u2022 Dual-Degree Ph.D. in Language and Information Technologies (CMU-PT Ph.D.) \u2022 Masters in Language Technologies (MLT) \u2022 Master of Science in Intelligent Information Systems (MIIS) \u2022 Master of Computational Data Science (MCDS) \u2022 Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence and Innovation (MSAII)|LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook Page 10 This handbook applies to the LTI Ph.D. The Ph.D. in Language and Information Technologies (LTI Ph.D. ) is focused on understanding and extending the state of the art in computational linguistics, natural language processing, dialogue systems, information retrieval, machine translation, speech processing, video understanding, multimodal systems, automated reasoning, and other topics related to analysis and understanding of unstructured information (e.g., machine learning, and software engineering of intelligent systems). 1.2 Department Personnel The people responsible for administering the LTI Ph.D. degree are: Jamie Callan Ph.D. Program Director Professor GHC 5419 callan@cs.cmu.edu 412-268-4525 Stacey Young Ph.D. Academic Program Manager LTI Graduate Program Manager GHC 6415 staceyy@cs.cmu.edu 412-268-2623 Mona Diab LTI Director Professor GHC 5723 mdiab@andrew.cmu.edu 412-268-3669 Joan Axelson Office Manager GHC 5405 jaxelson@andrew.cmu.edu 412-268-7517 Julie Nys Employment Processes Manger GHC 5405 jnys@andrew.cmu.edu 412-268-3515 1.3 University Policies and Expectations It is the responsibility of each member of the Carnegie Mellon community to be familiar with university policies and guidelines.

The student must apply for the Ph.D. at the usual time . However, students that are already enrolled in an LTI degree program are not required to retake GRE and TOEFL exams or to produce new transcripts from other universities. 4.1.8 Transferring Out of the Ph.D. Program The Ph.D. program doe s not prevent students from transferring to another degree program . A student who is interested in transferring out of the Ph.D. degree program should consult the handbook and Program Director of the desired degree program to learn whether transfers are permitted, and if so, how, and when to request such a transfer. 4.2 LTI Academic Policies 4.2.1 \u201cGrandfather\u201d Policy A student can graduate under the policies in effect at the time that the student entered the program; or, at the student's choice, the student can graduate under policies that are adopted after the student entered the program. If it is not realistic to follow a particular policy exactly, the department may approximate the policy as closely as possible; this situation is rare and typically arises only when a student is enrolled in the program for an extended period of time. 4.2.2 Definition of Transfer Credit vs. Course Exemption The LT I may grant transfer credit or issue an exemption for equivalent graduate courses previously completed at another institution. This decision rests with the director of the particular program. If a student is exempt from a required course due to prior cour ses or experience, the student can replace that course with an open elective. The student does not receive credit for the external course but can take any course that could normally count toward the degree in its place. If a student receives credit for pr ior coursework completed at CMU or elsewhere, the student receives that many units of credit, and the total amount of required coursework is reduced by that amount. 4.2.3 External Employment/Consulting Students funded by LTI research projects are expected to wor k primarily for those projects. Since consulting provides useful experience, students are generally permitted to consult at most one day per seven-day week, with the advisor's consent . International students must also have approval in advance from the Office of International Education (OIE) ; otherwise, they may be in violation of their visa status. See also External Internships",

Qualifying courses: MIIS-16 students must pass 72 units (typically 6 12-unit courses) and MIIS-21 students must complete 96 units (typically 8 12-unit courses) in qualifying master\u2019s courses. A qualifying master\u2019s course is defined as: a. Any graduate course (600-level or higher) offered by the Language Technologies Institute; and b. Any graduate course (600-level or higher) from the list of approved qualifying courses (Section 3. 2.4). 2. Free elective: Students must pass 12 units (typically 1 course) in elective master\u2019s course(s). A free elective is defined as: a. A graduate course (600-level or higher) with content relevant to the MIIS program objectives offered by the School of Computer Science ; and b. A course approved by the student's advisor and the degree Program Director. c. A student may not use the same course to satisfy both a qualifying course requirement and an elective course requirement. 3. Breadth requirements : Students must demonstrate breadth by passing one course in each of the following areas. In addition, MIIS-21 students must take two more LTI courses (24 units total) in one of the following areas of concentration: \u2022 Human language; \u2022 Machine learning; and \u2022 Language technology applications. The department maintains and publishes a list of courses that satisfy each of these requirements (Sections 3. 2.5 \u2013 3.2.7). Some c ourses used to satisfy a breadth requirement can also satisfy qualifying course requirements. A student should get approval from the director for the breadth courses , if not listed below. 4.4 Approved Qualifying Courses Any graduate course (600-level or higher) offered by the Language Technologies Institute is a qualifying course. Any two graduate courses (600-level or higher) offered by departments within the SCS relevant to the MIIS degree other than LTI (Machine Learning or Computer Science departments, etc.) may be counted as approved qualifying courses |MIIS Graduate Student Handbook Page 13 4 MIIS Degree Requirements and Related Policies/Protocols 4.1 Program Options The MIIS degree is offered in two options: Option 1. Standard MIIS degree (MIIS-16)-A 16-month track that is completed in three academic semesters (fall, spring, fall) and a summer internship. Option 2. MIIS: Advanced Study degree (MIIS-21)-A 21-month track that is completed in four academic semesters (fall, spring, fall, spring) and a summer internship. MIIS: Advanced Study track offers in depth degree in one of the following areas of concentration: \u2022 Human Language for Language Technologies \u2022 Language Technology Application \u2022 Machine Learning for Language Technologies Part-time options are available in some cases. 4.2 Required Units for Degree Attainment To complete the Master of Science in Intelligent Information Systems, a student must satisfy three types of requirements. Curricular requirements ensure that MIIS students receive instruction in core intelligent information systems technologies while also allowing an opportunity to specialize in areas of personal interest.

The student must apply for the Ph.D. at the usual time . However, students that are already enrolled in an LTI degree program are not required to retake GRE and TOEFL exams or to produce new transcripts from other universities. 4.1.8 Transferring Out of the Ph.D. Program The Ph.D. program doe s not prevent students from transferring to another degree program . A student who is interested in transferring out of the Ph.D. degree program should consult the handbook and Program Director of the desired degree program to learn whether transfers are permitted, and if so, how, and when to request such a transfer. 4.2 LTI Academic Policies 4.2.1 \u201cGrandfather\u201d Policy A student can graduate under the policies in effect at the time that the student entered the program; or, at the student's choice, the student can graduate under policies that are adopted after the student entered the program. If it is not realistic to follow a particular policy exactly, the department may approximate the policy as closely as possible; this situation is rare and typically arises only when a student is enrolled in the program for an extended period of time. 4.2.2 Definition of Transfer Credit vs. Course Exemption The LT I may grant transfer credit or issue an exemption for equivalent graduate courses previously completed at another institution. This decision rests with the director of the particular program. If a student is exempt from a required course due to prior cour ses or experience, the student can replace that course with an open elective. The student does not receive credit for the external course but can take any course that could normally count toward the degree in its place. If a student receives credit for pr ior coursework completed at CMU or elsewhere, the student receives that many units of credit, and the total amount of required coursework is reduced by that amount. 4.2.3 External Employment/Consulting Students funded by LTI research projects are expected to wor k primarily for those projects. Since consulting provides useful experience, students are generally permitted to consult at most one day per seven-day week, with the advisor's consent .

Turing Award for their work in artificial intelligence. (As of 2014, 12 CMU alumni or faculty have been awarded Turings, sometimes considered the Nobel Prize of computing.) Three years later, Simon received the Nobel Prize in Economics for his work on decision-making theory. As the 1970s progressed, Newell became interested in human-computer interaction, and began a long relationship with Xerox\u2019s Palo Alto Research Center, or PARC, which released the Xerox Alto in 1973. Considered a forerunner to many of the computing environments that followed, Alto featured a graphical-user interface and was among the first commercially available workstations controlled with a mouse.

Waibel Title: Convoifilter: A case study of doing cocktail party speech recognition Publication year: 2023 Coauthors: T. Nguyen, A. Waibel Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end model designed to improve automatic speech recognition (ASR) for a particular speaker in a crowded, noisy environment. The model utilizes a single-channel speech enhancement module that isolates the speaker's voice from background noise (ConVoiFilter) and an ASR module. The model can decrease ASR's word error rate (WER) from 80% to 26.4% through this approach. Typically, these two components are adjusted independently due to variations in data requirements. However, speech enhancement can create anomalies that decrease ASR efficiency. By implementing a joint fine-tuning strategy, the model can reduce the WER from 26.4% in separate tuning to 14.5% in joint tuning. We openly share our pre-trained model to foster further research hf.co/nguyenvulebinh/voice-filter.|23.

Robinson, Perez Ogayo, David R. Mortensen, Graham Neubig Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) implicitly learn to perform a range of language tasks, including machine translation (MT). Previous studies explore aspects of LLMs\u2019 MT capabilities. However, there exist a wide variety of languages for which recent LLM MT performance has never before been evaluated. Without published experimental evidence on the matter, it is difficult for speakers of the world\u2019s diverse languages to know how and whether they can use LLMs for their languages. We present the first experimental evidence for an expansive set of 204 languages, along with MT cost analysis, using the FLORES-200 benchmark. Trends reveal that GPT models approach or exceed traditional MT model performance for some high-resource languages (HRLs) but consistently lag for low-resource languages (LRLs), under-performing traditional MT for 84.1% of languages we covered. Our analysis reveals that a language\u2019s resource level is the most important feature in determining ChatGPT\u2019s relative ability to translate it, and suggests that ChatGPT is especially disadvantaged for LRLs and African languages.",

The prompts used by companies to guide their models are often treated as secrets, to be hidden from the user making the query. They have even been treated as commodities to be bought and sold. However, anecdotal reports have shown adversarial users employing prompt extraction attacks to recover these prompts. In this paper, we present a framework for systematically measuring the effectiveness of these attacks. In experiments with 3 different sources of prompts and 11 underlying large language models, we find that simple text-based attacks can in fact reveal prompts with high probability. Our framework determines with high precision whether an extracted prompt is the actual secret prompt, rather than a model hallucination. Prompt extraction experiments on real systems such as Bing Chat and ChatGPT suggest that system prompts can be revealed by an adversary despite existing defenses in place.|Author: A. Waibel Title: AdapITN: A Fast, Reliable, and Dynamic Adaptive Inverse Text Normalization Publication year: 2023 Coauthors: T. Nguyen, Le Duc Minh Nhat, Quang Minh Nguyen, Quoc Truong Do, C. Luong, A. Waibel Abstract: Inverse text normalization (ITN) is the task that transforms text in spoken-form into written-form. While automatic speech recognition (ASR) produces text in spoken-form, human and natural language understanding systems prefer to consume text in written-form. ITN generally deals with semiotic phrases (e.g., numbers, date, time).

The reason is that phonetization phrases are infinite patterns and language-dependent.

We call it \"Adap\" because it allows for handling unseen PHP.

Yet, AI systems' abilities in this realm remain elusive. We present SOTOPIA, an open-ended environment to simulate complex social interactions between artificial agents and evaluate their social intelligence. In our environment, agents role-play and interact under a wide variety of scenarios; they coordinate, collaborate, exchange, and compete with each other to achieve complex social goals. We simulate the role-play interaction between LLM-based agents and humans within this task space and evaluate their performance with a holistic evaluation framework called SOTOPIA-Eval. With SOTOPIA, we find significant differences between these models in terms of their social intelligence, and we identify a subset of SOTOPIA scenarios, SOTOPIA-hard, that is generally challenging for all models. We find that on this subset, GPT-4 achieves a significantly lower goal completion rate than humans and struggles to exhibit social commonsense reasoning and strategic communication skills. These findings demonstrate SOTOPIA's promise as a general platform for research on evaluating and improving social intelligence in artificial agents.",

Diab Abstract: We conduct a thorough investigation into the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing specifically on the Open Pretrained Transformers (OPT) models as a representative of such models. Our study entails finetuning three different sizes of OPT on a carefully curated reasoning corpus, resulting in two sets of finetuned models: OPT-R, finetuned without explanations, and OPT-RE, finetuned with explanations. We then evaluate all models on 57 out-of-domain tasks drawn from the Super-NaturalInstructions benchmark, covering 26 distinct reasoning skills, utilizing three prompting techniques. Through a comprehensive grid of 27 configurations and 6,156 test evaluations, we investigate the dimensions of finetuning, prompting, and scale to understand the role of explanations on different reasoning skills. Our findings reveal that having explanations in the fewshot exemplar has no significant impact on the model\u2019s performance when the model is finetuned, while positively affecting the non-finetuned counterpart. Moreover, we observe a slight yet consistent increase in classification accuracy as we incorporate explanations during prompting and finetuning, respectively. Finally, we offer insights on which reasoning skills benefit the most from incorporating explanations during finetuning and prompting, such as Numerical (+20.4%) and Analogical (+13.9%) reasoning, as well as skills that exhibit negligible or negative effects.",

Liang, R. Salakhutdinov, Louis-Philippe Morency Abstract: Multimodal machine learning, which studies the information and interactions across various input modalities, has made significant advancements in understanding the relationship between images and descriptive text. However, this is just a portion of the potential multimodal interactions seen in the real world and does not include new interactions between conflicting utterances and gestures in predicting sarcasm, for example. Notably, the current methods for capturing shared information often do not extend well to these more nuanced interactions, sometimes performing as low as 50% in binary classification. In this paper, we address this problem via a new approach called MMOE, which stands for a mixture of multimodal interaction experts. Our method automatically classifies data points from unlabeled multimodal datasets by their interaction type and employs specialized models for each specific interaction. Based on our experiments, this approach improves performance on these challenging interactions by more than 10%, leading to an overall increase of 2% for tasks like sarcasm prediction. As a result, interaction quantification provides new insights for dataset analysis and yields simple approaches that obtain state-of-the-art performance.",

Recent research has hinted in the affirmative, finding that brain signals can be effectively predicted using the internal representations of language models (LMs). Although such results are thought to reflect shared computational principles between LMs and human brains, there are also clear differences in how LMs and humans represent and use language. In this work, we systematically explore the divergences between human and machine language processing by examining the differences between LM representations and human brain responses to language as measured by Magnetoencephalography (MEG) across two datasets in which subjects read and listened to narrative stories. Using a data-driven approach, we identify two domains that are not captured well by LMs: social/emotional intelligence and physical commonsense. We then validate these domains with human behavioral experiments and show that fine-tuning LMs on these domains can improve their alignment with human brain responses.|Author: Maarten Sap Title: Clever Hans or Neural Theory of Mind? Stress Testing Social Reasoning in Large Language Models Publication year: 2023 Coauthors: Natalie Shapira, Mosh Levy, S. Alavi, Xuhui Zhou, Yejin Choi, Yoav Goldberg, Maarten Sap, Vered Shwartz Abstract: The escalating debate on AI's capabilities warrants developing reliable metrics to assess machine\"intelligence\". Recently, many anecdotal examples were used to suggest that newer large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and GPT-4 exhibit Neural Theory-of-Mind (N-ToM); however, prior work reached conflicting conclusions regarding those abilities. We investigate the extent of LLMs' N-ToM through an extensive evaluation on 6 tasks and find that while LLMs exhibit certain N-ToM abilities, this behavior is far from being robust. We further examine the factors impacting performance on N-ToM tasks and discover that LLMs struggle with adversarial examples, indicating reliance on shallow heuristics rather than robust ToM abilities. We caution against drawing conclusions from anecdotal examples, limited benchmark testing, and using human-designed psychological tests to evaluate models.",

Turing Award for their work in artificial intelligence. (As of 2014, 12 CMU alumni or faculty have been awarded Turings, sometimes considered the Nobel Prize of computing.) Three years later, Simon received the Nobel Prize in Economics for his work on decision-making theory. As the 1970s progressed, Newell became interested in human-computer interaction, and began a long relationship with Xerox\u2019s Palo Alto Research Center, or PARC, which released the Xerox Alto in 1973. Considered a forerunner to many of the computing environments that followed, Alto featured a graphical-user interface and was among the first commercially available workstations controlled with a mouse. Inspired by Alto, Reddy launched a drive for development of CMU\u2019s own \u201cthree-M\u201d machine\u2014a personal workstation with a megabyte of memory, a megapixel display and at least one million instructions per second of processing power.\n| \nCommitted to extending our founders\u2019 vision\n\nThe School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University enters its second quarter century as a world-leading educational and research institution, embracing all facets of computing. Its graduate programs are consisted ranked with the best in the world by a leading U.S. magazine, while its undergraduate programs are also rated the best in the U.S. by corporate recruiters. In 2013, SCS had 284 faculty members and a total student enrollment of nearly 1,700, including undergraduate, master\u2019s and Ph.D. students, and conducted $124 million in research. Indeed, by itself, the Robotics Institute is the largest university robotics research group in the world, with more than 500 people and more than 100 ongoing research projects. A half-century ago, Perlis, Simon and Newell outlined a vision for computer science. The School of Computer Science at CMU remains committed to continuing and extending their vision in the context of big data and connected computing in the 21st century.\n",

Previous studies explore aspects of LLMs\u2019 MT capabilities. However, there exist a wide variety of languages for which recent LLM MT performance has never before been evaluated. Without published experimental evidence on the matter, it is difficult for speakers of the world\u2019s diverse languages to know how and whether they can use LLMs for their languages. We present the first experimental evidence for an expansive set of 204 languages, along with MT cost analysis, using the FLORES-200 benchmark. Trends reveal that GPT models approach or exceed traditional MT model performance for some high-resource languages (HRLs) but consistently lag for low-resource languages (LRLs), under-performing traditional MT for 84.1% of languages we covered. Our analysis reveals that a language\u2019s resource level is the most important feature in determining ChatGPT\u2019s relative ability to translate it, and suggests that ChatGPT is especially disadvantaged for LRLs and African languages.|Author: Graham Neubig Title: ChatGPT MT: Competitive for High- (but Not Low-) Resource Languages Publication year: 2023 Coauthors: Nathaniel R.

The sections below provide more detail about each of these requirements. 3.1.1 Course Requirements To complete the course requirements for the Ph.D. in Language and Information Technologies degree, the student must pass 96 or more course units of graduate courses, and meet the following criteria: \u2022 At least 72 units of \u201cLTI\u201d courses and 24 units of \u201cSCS\u201d courses, \u2022 At least one class in each \u201cLTI Focus Area\u201d, and \u2022 At least two labs, in two different research areas . For definitions of quoted terms, see the section on \u201cDefinitions of LTI Terminology\u201d. Unless approved by the Program Director in advance, the course requirements must be satisfied by actual classroom courses, not credit given for research or independent study. An \u201cLTI course \u201d is any 12-unit course with a number of 11-XXX; a 6-unit course with 11-XXX counts as one-half of an LTI course.

They will decide, with advice from faculty in the appropriate area, whether it should be in the Focus Area. I f approved , it will be added to the LTI Focus Area webpage. A \u201cTask-Orientation Focus Course \u201d is a course belonging to that LTI Focus Area, as listed on the LTI\u2019s \u201cCourse Categories\u201d webpage. An LTI \u201c lab course \u201d is a course in the list of lab courses defined o n the LTI \u2019s \u201cCourse Categories\u201d webpage . 3.1.2 Grade Requirements Students must demonstrate their mastery of material taught in courses and their success in applying their skills in directed stu dy by satisfying the following grade requirements . Minimum grade: Only courses with a grade of B (3.0) or higher are counted as satisfying a degree requirement. Pass/fail: Pass/fail grades are not permitted for courses and projects used to satisfy a degree requirement. 3.1.3 Proficiency Requirements The LTI Ph.D. does not require any Qualifying Exams. Instead, a LTI Ph.D. student is required to demonstrate proficiency in the following four areas. \u2022 Writing: This is satisfied by producing a peer-reviewed conference paper, or the equivalent (a written report that at least two SCS faculty certify as being of conference-paper quality). \u2022 Presentation: This is satisfied by the oral presentation of a conference paper, or the equivalent (an oral presentation that at least t wo SCS faculty certify as being of conference-talk quality). \u2022 Programming: This is satisfied by demonstrating competence in computer programming of language technology; this is normally satisfied in the course of the student's research and/or project work|LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook Page 25 Note that self-funded Ph.D. students (e.g., those registered for five units while on semester interns hip) are not permitted to receive a partial stipend for the semester of their internship, while full-time LTI-sponsored students are eligible for a partial stipend. All students are caution ed to be aware of potential intellectual property (IP) problems with internships, and to review any IP agreements with their advisors before signing them. It is possible to lose ownership of your ideas. If the student is to receive academic credit for the internship, it must have deliverables from the student commensurate with the number of units, they are taking. This can be in the form of interim and final reports on the experience, presentations in the following semester regarding the experience, assessments of their experience as it relates to their course of study, etc. 4.1.3 Maximum Courseload Ph.D. students are permitted to register for a maximum of 54 units of coursework per semester. 4.1.4 Pass/Fail Grades Pass/fail grades are not permitted for courses used to satisfy a degree requirement. Graduate students who are required to take additional undergraduate courses to build up the core foundations of computer science may not elect the pass/fail option for th ese courses. 4.1.5 Transfer Credit An equivalent graduate course previously completed at another institution may be permitted to satisfy one of the Ph.D. course requirements. The decision on whether a course may be transferred is made by the Ph.D. Program Direct or. Typically, the student will provide the Program Director with the syllabus of the external course, and the Program Director will use that and the student\u2019s transcript to make the decision.

The student must apply for the Ph.D. at the usual time . However, students that are already enrolled in an LTI degree program are not required to retake GRE and TOEFL exams or to produce new transcripts from other universities. 4.1.8 Transferring Out of the Ph.D. Program The Ph.D. program doe s not prevent students from transferring to another degree program . A student who is interested in transferring out of the Ph.D. degree program should consult the handbook and Program Director of the desired degree program to learn whether transfers are permitted, and if so, how, and when to request such a transfer. 4.2 LTI Academic Policies 4.2.1 \u201cGrandfather\u201d Policy A student can graduate under the policies in effect at the time that the student entered the program; or, at the student's choice, the student can graduate under policies that are adopted after the student entered the program. If it is not realistic to follow a particular policy exactly, the department may approximate the policy as closely as possible; this situation is rare and typically arises only when a student is enrolled in the program for an extended period of time. 4.2.2 Definition of Transfer Credit vs. Course Exemption The LT I may grant transfer credit or issue an exemption for equivalent graduate courses previously completed at another institution. This decision rests with the director of the particular program. If a student is exempt from a required course due to prior cour ses or experience, the student can replace that course with an open elective. The student does not receive credit for the external course but can take any course that could normally count toward the degree in its place. If a student receives credit for pr ior coursework completed at CMU or elsewhere, the student receives that many units of credit, and the total amount of required coursework is reduced by that amount. 4.2.3 External Employment/Consulting Students funded by LTI research projects are expected to wor k primarily for those projects. Since consulting provides useful experience, students are generally permitted to consult at most one day per seven-day week, with the advisor's consent . International students must also have approval in advance from the Office of International Education (OIE) ; otherwise, they may be in violation of their visa status.

You can obtain a copy by contacting the Carnegie Mellon Police Department at 412-268-2323. The annual security and fire safety re port also is available online at www.cmu.edu/police/annualreports .. Information regarding the application of Title IX, including to admission and employment decisions, the sexual misconduct grievance proced ures and process, including how to file a report or a complaint of sex discrimination, how to file a report of sexual harassment, and how the university responds to su ch reports is available at www.cmu.edu/title-ix . The Title IX coordinator may be reached at 4615 Forbes Ave, Suite 330, Pittsburgh, PA 15213; 412-268-7125; or tix@cmu.edu . 4 Carnegie Mellon Code Students at Carnegie Mellon, because they are members of an academic community dedicated to the achievement of excellence, are expected to m eet the highest standards of personal, ethical and moral conduct possible. These standards require personal integrity, a commitment to honesty without compromise, as well as truth without equivocation and a willingne ss to place the good of the community above the good of the self. Obligations once un dertaken must be me t, commitments kept. As members of the Carnegie Mellon community , individuals are expected to uphold the standards of the community in a ddition to holding others accountable for said standards. It is rare that the life of a student in an academic community can be so private that it will not affect the community as a whole or that the above standards do not apply. The discovery, advancement, and communicatio n of knowledge are not possible without a commitment to these standards. Creativity cannot exist without acknowledgment of the creativity of others. New knowledge cannot be developed without credit for prior knowledge. Without the ability to trust that these princ iples will be observed, an academic community cannot exist. The commitment of its faculty, staff, and students to these standards contributes to the high respect in which the Carnegie Mellon degree is he ld. Students must not de stroy that respect by",

        "retrieved_doc": "133.2 Full-time Status All MCDS students are expected to enroll full-time (at present, there is no option to pursue the degree as a part-time student). To be considered a full-time student, a student must be registered for, and complete, a minimum of 36 units in every Fall and Spring semester. All international students are required by US Federal law to maintain full-time status. Students can have no more than one (1) remote course counting toward the 36 units used to satisfy full-time enrollment. Failure to maintain full-time status will result in loss of a student visa (and, therefore, \u201cpermit of stay\u201d). All students having a Stafford Loan are required to maintain full-time status. 3.3 MCDS Degree Enrollment Process and Related Information 3.3.1 Duration of the degree program The MCDS degree must be completed within five (5) years from the time that the student matriculates into the program. https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of-limitations.html As outlined in the Master\u2019s Students Statute of Limitations (see link above), students will complete all requirements for the master\u2019s degree within a maximum of seven years from original matriculation as a master\u2019s student, or less if required by a more restrictive department, school or college policy. Once this time-to-degree limit has lapsed, the person may resume work towards a master\u2019s degree only if newly admitted to a currently offered master\u2019s degree program under criteria determined by that program. Under extraordinary circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, family or parental leave, or temporary disability, a school or college may, upon the relevant department's recommendation and with the written approval of the dean (or designate), defer the lapse for a period commensurate with the duration of that interruption. Students who are pursuing a master\u2019s degree as part-time students for all semesters of their program, as approved by their program, may also appeal to their program or department for extension of the time to degree limit. 3.3.2 Residency requirements There is no formal residence requirement. However, most courses in the program are taught on campus without an option for distance education. Students enrolled in in-person course sections (IPR) are expected to attend all class meetings in person. 3.3.3 Degree Certification: Course requirements and related policies/protocols|MIIS Graduate Student Handbook Page 14 A MIIS student must complete the following curricular requirements: 1. Qualifying courses: MIIS-16 students must pass 72 units (typically 6 12-unit courses) and MIIS-21 students must complete 96 units (typically 8 12-unit courses) in qualifying master\u2019s courses. A qualifying master\u2019s course is defined as: a. Any graduate course (600-level or higher) offered by the Language Technologies Institute; and b. Any graduate course (600-level or higher) from the list of approved qualifying courses (Section 3. 2.4). 2. Free elective: Students must pass 12 units (typically 1 course) in elective master\u2019s course(s). A free elective is defined as: a. A graduate course (600-level or higher) with content relevant to the MIIS program objectives offered by the School of Computer Science ; and b. A course approved by the student's advisor and the degree Program Director. c. A student may not use the same course to satisfy both a qualifying course requirement and an elective course requirement. 3. Breadth requirements : Students must demonstrate breadth by passing one course in each of the following areas. In addition, MIIS-21 students must take two more LTI courses (24 units total) in one of the following areas of concentration: \u2022 Human language; \u2022 Machine learning; and \u2022 Language technology applications. The department maintains and publishes a list of courses that satisfy each of these requirements (Sections 3. 2.5 \u2013 3.2.7).

A student should get approval from the director for the breadth courses , if not listed below. 4.4 Approved Qualifying Courses Any graduate course (600-level or higher) offered by the Language Technologies Institute is a qualifying course. Any two graduate courses (600-level or higher) offered by departments within the SCS relevant to the MIIS degree other than LTI (Machine Learning or Computer Science departments, etc.) may be counted as approved qualifying courses |12granting program or department to determine if early degree certification is allowed and under what circumstances. Extended or Longer-than-Standard Completion Longer-than-standard degree completion may occur due to academic interruptions in making progress toward the degree as defined by the academic program, interruptions of full-time study or progress towards the degree due to serious, documented medical issues, or other unusual or unforeseen circumstances. Master\u2019s students who require longer than the standard time to complete their degree requirements are expected to remain in close contact with their graduate program and will be certified at the end of the semester in which they have completed their degree requirements. Policy on Master\u2019s Student Statute of Limitations www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of-limitations.html See the above link regarding guidelines and restrictions which place an upper limit on the maximum length of time allowable for master\u2019s degree completion and certification. Additional Guidance for Students Program of study. Students seeking guidance about their program of study and degree requirements should consult with their academic advisor and/or appropriate associate dean. Financial aid and student account Students are expected to make normal progress toward their degree to graduate within the standard timeframe for their program of study. Under U.S. Federal Title IV regulations, student eligibility for federal financial aid is contingent upon enrollment in and successful completion of courses that are counted as credit toward their current degree program. To receive the maximum amount of federal financial aid for which they may be eligible, students must enroll each semester in at least 36 units that count toward their current degree level. (See separate guidance regarding integrated degree completion.) Students should consult with their designated college liaison in The HUB regarding billing and financial aid, particularly for early completion, longer-than-standard completion, or integrated undergraduate and master\u2019s degree programs. International students Immigration status for students in F-1 and J-1 non-immigrant status is tied to making normal progress toward completing degree requirements. Therefore, F-1 and J-1 students who are considering completing their degree requirements early, anticipating longer-than-standard completion, or moving from an undergraduate to a graduate student classification (integrated undergraduate-graduate study) should consult with their designated advisor in the Office of International Education (OIE) to ensure compliance with immigration regulations",

Carnegie Mellon University educates its students to become professionals who will serve society with integrity. The university also creates and disseminates new knowledge and expressions of knowledge in ways that benefit society. Carnegie Mellon strives to serve the changing needs of society through the three primary goals outlined in its mission statement: to create and disseminate knowledge and art through research and artistic expression, teaching and learning and transfer to society, to serve students by teaching them leadership and problem-solving skills, and the values of quality, ethical behavior, responsibility to society and commitments to work, to pursue the advantages provided by a diverse community, open to the exchange of ideas, where discovery and artistic creativity can flourish. In any presentation, creative, artistic or research, it is the ethical responsibility of each student to identify the conceptual sources of the work submitted. Failure to do so is dishonest and is the basis for a charge of cheating or plagiarism, which is subject to disciplinary action. Please review the University Policy on Academic Integrity (https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html ). The policy includes the University expectations around academic integrity and provides definitions of cheating, plagiarism, and unauthorized assistance. A review of the University\u2019s Academic Disciplinary Actions procedures (https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/academic-discipline/index.html ) is also recommended. These procedures outline the process for investigating, reporting, and adjudicating violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity. The procedures also outline the appeal process. 3.7.2 Protocol for Academic Integrity Violations The university has a very clear and specific protocol for responding to alleged violations of academic integrity. Carnegie Mellon's Academic Disciplinary Actions Overview for Graduate Students describes procedures and the appeal process for disciplinary actions against graduate students in cases of alleged academic integrity violation.

It is an absolute requirement that the work you submit must be your own, unless you specifically identify the source of any material th at is not yours. This includes quotations and material from websites. In any written work (including presentations) you MUST list any person other than yourself who assisted you in preparing that wo rk. Any student who violates the academic integrity policy will be subject to a University review that may result in suspension or expulsion under University policies. THE PROGRAM DIRECTOR, THE FACULTY AND THE UNIVERSITY ARE VERY SERIOUS ABOUT ENFORCEMENT OF THE ACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY. You are not permitted to copy material from web pages, including Wikipedia, and present them as your own work. Any copied material MUST appe ar in quotation marks or italics and MUST be accompanied by a citation to the original source. Failure to do this violates CMU\u2019s Policy on Academic Integrity, which states, \u201cIn all academic work to be graded, the citation of all sources is required. \u2026 Plagiarism is defined as the use of work or concepts contributed by other individuals without proper attribution or citation . Unique ideas or materia ls taken from another source for either written or oral use must be fully acknowledged in academic work to be graded.\u201d It is a violation of academic integrity for you to assist anyone else in violating the policy or to provide your work to others to assist them. Be cause team deliverables are the product of joint work, it is the responsibility of each member of a team to ensure that all team materials have been produced in conformance with CMU policies. Credit cannot be given fo r work that is not a student\u2019s own. Therefore, if one member of a team violates a policy, for example, by copying material from the Internet without indicating it s source, then no one on the team can receive credit for that work, even if only one studen t is directly guilty of violating the policy. We are aware that acts that constitute cheating can be viewed very di fferently in different countries and cultures. However, Carnegie Me llon is a U.S. university and its policies reflect U.S. culture.
