CSD professor Mary Shaw (CS\u201972) led CMU\u2019s first effort to design an undergraduate curriculum solely in computer science. She and her colleagues were guided by the Carnegie Plan\u2014guidelines established in 1938 under Carnegie Tech President Robert Doherty (A\u201940, E\u201948, H\u201950), outlining the principles of a sound professional education. Drawing on Shaw\u2019s plan and also on the work of other faculty members, an undergraduate program in computer science was created during the 1989-90 academic year. Seven CS majors were admitted to the program as sophomores. Another 73 undergraduates were admitted in 1990\u201391. By 1995, there were 401 undergraduates in the School of Computer Science; in fall 2013, more than 600 undergraduates made up about 37 percent of student enrollment at SCS, along with more than 600 master\u2019s degree students.\n| \nComputer science Ph.D. program created\n\nIn 1961, the Computation Center and its newest computer, a Bendix G-20, were moved to recently completed Scaife Hall.
