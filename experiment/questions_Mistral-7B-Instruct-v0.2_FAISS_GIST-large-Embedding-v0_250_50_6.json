You have joined a Ph.D. program that focuses on excellence, creativity, and training the next generation of research leaders. While the next few years will be a time of hard work and intense concentration, we hope that your time at the LTI will also be rewarding professionally and personally. Obtaining a Ph.D. is a long and often intense journey. A healthy work-life balance helps to keep it in perspective. Carnegie Mellon is located in Pittsburgh, a city with a rich industrial and labor heritage. In the past, it was the heart of the U.S. steel industry, a source for quality packaged foods, an important financial hub, and an early pioneer in railroads, radio, and nuclear power. This is a city where people worked hard and made things that changed the world. Today, Pittsburgh has reinvented itself as a leader in Computer Science and medicine, but it is still a place where people work hard and make things that change the world . It is also an informal city, where people don\u2019t take themselves too seriously and remember to have fun. It is home to excellent museums, competitive professional sports teams, inexpensive magic shows, and free music during the summer, with skiing and magnificent state parks nearby. Your stay here will be more rewarding if you make time for e xploring the many activities that Pittsburgh and Southwest Pennsylvania have to offer. There are significant differences between CMU's different departments and degree programs in philosophical approach, procedures, policies, and regulations. Each department issues a handbook that informs graduate students of their program requirements and procedures and ensures that students have written access to standard information. This handbook describes the policies, procedures, and requirements for the Ph.D. in Language and Information Technologies. All policies not explicitly described in this document conform to School of Computer Science (SCS) policies and university policies. For information about Carnegie Mellon requirements and policies, please see the university\u2019s handbook The Word , the Office of Graduate and Postdoctoral Affairs web page , the Office of the Dean of Students web page , and other resources contained in Appendix A of this handbook. Welcome! We hope that your time here is a life-changing experience. 1.1 Degrees Offered The Language Technologies Institute offers two Ph.D. programs and four Master degrees. \u2022 Ph.D. in Language and Information Technologies (LTI Ph.D. ) \u2022 Dual-Degree Ph.D. in Language and Information Technologies (CMU-PT Ph.D.) \u2022 Masters in Language Technologies (MLT) \u2022 Master of Science in Intelligent Information Systems (MIIS) \u2022 Master of Computational Data Science (MCDS) \u2022 Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence and Innovation (MSAII)|LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook Page 10 This handbook applies to the LTI Ph.D. The Ph.D. in Language and Information Technologies (LTI Ph.D. ) is focused on understanding and extending the state of the art in computational linguistics, natural language processing, dialogue systems, information retrieval, machine translation, speech processing, video understanding, multimodal systems, automated reasoning, and other topics related to analysis and understanding of unstructured information (e.g., machine learning, and software engineering of intelligent systems). 1.2 Department Personnel The people responsible for administering the LTI Ph.D. degree are: Jamie Callan Ph.D. Program Director Professor GHC 5419 callan@cs.cmu.edu 412-268-4525 Stacey Young Ph.D. Academic Program Manager LTI Graduate Program Manager GHC 6415 staceyy@cs.cmu.edu 412-268-2623 Mona Diab LTI Director Professor GHC 5723 mdiab@andrew.cmu.edu 412-268-3669 Joan Axelson Office Manager GHC 5405 jaxelson@andrew.cmu.edu 412-268-7517 Julie Nys Employment Processes Manger GHC 5405 jnys@andrew.cmu.edu 412-268-3515 1.3 University Policies and Expectations It is the responsibility of each member of the Carnegie Mellon community to be familiar with university policies and guidelines.

The student must apply for the Ph.D. at the usual time . However, students that are already enrolled in an LTI degree program are not required to retake GRE and TOEFL exams or to produce new transcripts from other universities. 4.1.8 Transferring Out of the Ph.D. Program The Ph.D. program doe s not prevent students from transferring to another degree program . A student who is interested in transferring out of the Ph.D. degree program should consult the handbook and Program Director of the desired degree program to learn whether transfers are permitted, and if so, how, and when to request such a transfer. 4.2 LTI Academic Policies 4.2.1 \u201cGrandfather\u201d Policy A student can graduate under the policies in effect at the time that the student entered the program; or, at the student's choice, the student can graduate under policies that are adopted after the student entered the program. If it is not realistic to follow a particular policy exactly, the department may approximate the policy as closely as possible; this situation is rare and typically arises only when a student is enrolled in the program for an extended period of time. 4.2.2 Definition of Transfer Credit vs. Course Exemption The LT I may grant transfer credit or issue an exemption for equivalent graduate courses previously completed at another institution. This decision rests with the director of the particular program. If a student is exempt from a required course due to prior cour ses or experience, the student can replace that course with an open elective. The student does not receive credit for the external course but can take any course that could normally count toward the degree in its place. If a student receives credit for pr ior coursework completed at CMU or elsewhere, the student receives that many units of credit, and the total amount of required coursework is reduced by that amount. 4.2.3 External Employment/Consulting Students funded by LTI research projects are expected to wor k primarily for those projects. Since consulting provides useful experience, students are generally permitted to consult at most one day per seven-day week, with the advisor's consent . International students must also have approval in advance from the Office of International Education (OIE) ; otherwise, they may be in violation of their visa status.

        "retrieved_doc": "MIIS Graduate Student Handbook Page 14 A MIIS student must complete the following curricular requirements: 1. Qualifying courses: MIIS-16 students must pass 72 units (typically 6 12-unit courses) and MIIS-21 students must complete 96 units (typically 8 12-unit courses) in qualifying master\u2019s courses. A qualifying master\u2019s course is defined as: a. Any graduate course (600-level or higher) offered by the Language Technologies Institute; and b. Any graduate course (600-level or higher) from the list of approved qualifying courses (Section 3. 2.4). 2. Free elective: Students must pass 12 units (typically 1 course) in elective master\u2019s course(s). A free elective is defined as: a. A graduate course (600-level or higher) with content relevant to the MIIS program objectives offered by the School of Computer Science ; and b. A course approved by the student's advisor and the degree Program Director. c. A student may not use the same course to satisfy both a qualifying course requirement and an elective course requirement. 3. Breadth requirements : Students must demonstrate breadth by passing one course in each of the following areas. In addition, MIIS-21 students must take two more LTI courses (24 units total) in one of the following areas of concentration: \u2022 Human language; \u2022 Machine learning; and \u2022 Language technology applications. The department maintains and publishes a list of courses that satisfy each of these requirements (Sections 3. 2.5 \u2013 3.2.7). Some c ourses used to satisfy a breadth requirement can also satisfy qualifying course requirements. A student should get approval from the director for the breadth courses , if not listed below. 4.4 Approved Qualifying Courses Any graduate course (600-level or higher) offered by the Language Technologies Institute is a qualifying course. Any two graduate courses (600-level or higher) offered by departments within the SCS relevant to the MIIS degree other than LTI (Machine Learning or Computer Science departments, etc.) may be counted as approved qualifying courses |MIIS Graduate Student Handbook Page 13 4 MIIS Degree Requirements and Related Policies/Protocols 4.1 Program Options The MIIS degree is offered in two options: Option 1. Standard MIIS degree (MIIS-16)-A 16-month track that is completed in three academic semesters (fall, spring, fall) and a summer internship. Option 2. MIIS: Advanced Study degree (MIIS-21)-A 21-month track that is completed in four academic semesters (fall, spring, fall, spring) and a summer internship. MIIS: Advanced Study track offers in depth degree in one of the following areas of concentration: \u2022 Human Language for Language Technologies \u2022 Language Technology Application \u2022 Machine Learning for Language Technologies Part-time options are available in some cases. 4.2 Required Units for Degree Attainment To complete the Master of Science in Intelligent Information Systems, a student must satisfy three types of requirements. Curricular requirements ensure that MIIS students receive instruction in core intelligent information systems technologies while also allowing an opportunity to specialize in areas of personal interest. Practice requirements are opportunities to apply and hone new skills while building state-of-the-art systems. Grade requirements ensure that students have demonstrated a certain level of sk ill while completing degree requirements. All three types of requirements are described below. MIIS-16 students must take at least 84 units (typically 7 12-unit courses) of qualifying and elective courses that satisfy human language, machine learning, and language technology applications breadth requirements and 66 practice units for a total of 150 units to attain the Standard MIIS degree. MIIS-21 students must take at least 108 units (typically 9 12-unit courses) of qualifying and elective courses and 66 practice units to satisfy their degree requirements, making it a total of 174 units to attain the MIIS: Advanced Study degree. 4.3 Core Requirements|Master of Science in Intelligent Information Systems (MIIS) Requirements:   The Intelligent Information Systems degree offers students the flexibility to create their own course of study in consultation with their advisor.   MIIS students gain three types of practical experience: software development supervised by their advisor (24 units equivalent to two courses); a summer internship (which can be waived for students that have sufficient prior professional experience); and a capstone project executed in a group of peers (42 units equivalent to three 12-unit courses and one 6-unit course). This combination is proven to help IIS students to broaden their skills quickly. The MIIS degree is offered in two options:  Option 1. Standard MIIS degree (MIIS-16) - A 16-month track that is completed in three academic semesters (fall, spring, fall) and a summer internship.    Option 2. MIIS: Advanced Study degree (MIIS-21) - A 21-month track that is completed in four academic semesters (fall, spring, fall, spring) and a summer internship.  MIIS: Advanced Study track offers indepth degree in one of the following areas of concentration:      Human Language for Language Technologies     Language Technology Application     Machine Learning for Language Technologies  Part-time education option is available in some cases.   MIIS-16 students must take at least 84 units (typically 7 courses) of qualifying and elective courses that satisfy human language, machine learning, and language technology applications breadth requirements. MIIS-21 students have to take at least two more courses from the selected concentration area to satisfy their degree requirements, making it total of 108 units (typically 9 courses) of qualifying and elective courses, that also satisfy breadth requirements.  For a full list of requirements, read the MIIS Handbook.|MIIS Graduate Student Handbook Page 25 Director. Typically , the student will provide the Program Director with the syllabus of the external course, and the Program Director will use that and the student\u2019s transcript to make the decision. Satisfying a breadth requirement with a course from another institution does not reduce the number of CMU course units that must be taken to attain the MIIS degree. See the section on \u201cDefinition of transfer credit versus course exemption\u201d on page 2 5. 6.1.6 Transferring into the MIIS Program Transfers into the MIIS program are not permitted during a student\u2019s first semester at CMU. Students must begin their study at CMU in the program that admitted them. Students may request to transfer into the MIIS program after completing their first semester and before the add/drop deadline of the spring semester. The student must make the request in writing (or email) to the MIIS Program Director. The MIIS Program D irector will inform the student about what application materials are required, for example, an explanation of why a transfer is desired, a proposed plan of study, a proposed advisor, and CMU transcripts. Students that are already enrolled in an LTI degree program are not required to retake GRE and TOEFL /IELTS/Duolingo exams or to produce new transcripts from other universities. The MIIS program will conduct an expedited admissions process after receiving such a request. The program will explicitly consider whether the coursework done prior to the transfer will allow the student to be \u201con schedule\u201d by the end of the spring semest er, so that the student can participate in a capstone project with other MIIS students during the next fall semester. MIIS students are allowed to switch tracks (MIIS-16 to MIIS-21 and vice versa) after beginning their first semester at CMU. Ideally, all switch requests must be filed within the first semester of the program. It is highly recommended to not switch tracks more than once! Though not forbidden, multiple track switching may negatively impact immigration records of international students. Students also must understand that extension of their stay in the program will lead to additional financial obligations. U.S. citizens, virtually, have no restrictions on how many times they can switch if it is done for a legitimate reason. To confirm legitimacy of the reason to switch tracks ALL students must seek their advisor's approval and the approval of the Director of the MIIS program. 6.1.7 Transferring Out of the MIIS Program The MIIS program does not prevent students from transferring to another degree program. Each degree program has its own rules about whether and when transfers into the program are permitted. A student that is interested in transferring out of the MIIS de gree program should consult the handbook and Program Director of the desired degree program to learn whether transfers are permitted, and if so, how, and when to request such a transfer|MIIS Graduate Student Handbook Page 16 \u2022 11-785, Introduction to Deep Learning \u2022 10-601, Introduction to Machine Learning (Master\u2019s) \u2022 10-605, Machine Learning with Large Datasets \u2022 10-701, Introduction to Machine Learning (PhD) \u2022 10-707, Advanced Deep Learning \u2022 10-708, Probabilistic Graphical Models \u2022 10-714, Deep Learning Systems \u2022 10-715, Advanced Introduction to Machine Learning 4.5 Practice Requirements A student must complete at least 66 practice-oriented course units and satisfy the following practice-oriented requirements for both MIIS-16 and MIIS-21 programs. 1. Directed study requirement: Students must pass 24 units (typically 12 units x 2 semesters) in directed study under the supervision of their advisor. Directed study is a structured, task-oriented form of independent study that provides deep, hands-on experience in a particular technology area and an opportunity to work closely with a member of the faculty. 2. Internship requirement: Students must complete a one-semester (typically summer) internship at an organization (typically a company or government agency) approved by the MIIS Program Director. Internships are an opportunity to apply new skills in a professional setting and to le arn about software development in a \u2018real world\u2019 organization. Students with prior professional experience may petition the MIIS Program Director to waive this requirement. MIIS students that do an internship during the summer semester are required to present their internship at a poster session at the beginning of the following Fall semester. The poster and the student\u2019s participation in the poster session are part of the internship requirement. Participation is required unless waived in writing by the MIIS Program Director. 3. Capstone requirements: Students must complete a capstone project (36 units) and a capstone planning seminar (6 units). The capstone requirement gives students experience with collaborative, team-oriented software development; significant hands-on experience with the techniques studied in the classroom; and an opportunity to work on a large software application. a. The capstone project (36 units) is a large, group-oriented demonstration of student skill in one or more areas covered by the degree. Typically, the result of the capstone project is a major software application. The capstone project is supervised by a member of the faculty who meets with students on a weekly basis to monitor progress and provide guidance|Master of Science in Intelligent Information Systems (MIIS) Admission:   Carnegie Mellon's School of Computer Science has a centralized online application process.

The student must apply for the Ph.D. at the usual time . However, students that are already enrolled in an LTI degree program are not required to retake GRE and TOEFL exams or to produce new transcripts from other universities. 4.1.8 Transferring Out of the Ph.D. Program The Ph.D. program doe s not prevent students from transferring to another degree program . A student who is interested in transferring out of the Ph.D. degree program should consult the handbook and Program Director of the desired degree program to learn whether transfers are permitted, and if so, how, and when to request such a transfer. 4.2 LTI Academic Policies 4.2.1 \u201cGrandfather\u201d Policy A student can graduate under the policies in effect at the time that the student entered the program; or, at the student's choice, the student can graduate under policies that are adopted after the student entered the program. If it is not realistic to follow a particular policy exactly, the department may approximate the policy as closely as possible; this situation is rare and typically arises only when a student is enrolled in the program for an extended period of time. 4.2.2 Definition of Transfer Credit vs. Course Exemption The LT I may grant transfer credit or issue an exemption for equivalent graduate courses previously completed at another institution. This decision rests with the director of the particular program. If a student is exempt from a required course due to prior cour ses or experience, the student can replace that course with an open elective. The student does not receive credit for the external course but can take any course that could normally count toward the degree in its place. If a student receives credit for pr ior coursework completed at CMU or elsewhere, the student receives that many units of credit, and the total amount of required coursework is reduced by that amount. 4.2.3 External Employment/Consulting Students funded by LTI research projects are expected to wor k primarily for those projects. Since consulting provides useful experience, students are generally permitted to consult at most one day per seven-day week, with the advisor's consent . International students must also have approval in advance from the Office of International Education (OIE) ; otherwise, they may be in violation of their visa status.

All students are caution ed to be aware of potential intellectual property (IP) problems with internships, and to review any IP agreements with their advisors before signing them. It is possible to lose ownership of your ideas. If the student is to receive academic credit for the internship, it must have deliverables from the student commensurate with the number of units, they are taking. This can be in the form of interim and final reports on the experience, presentations in the following semester regarding the experience, assessments of their experience as it relates to their course of study, etc. 4.1.3 Maximum Courseload Ph.D. students are permitted to register for a maximum of 54 units of coursework per semester. 4.1.4 Pass/Fail Grades Pass/fail grades are not permitted for courses used to satisfy a degree requirement. Graduate students who are required to take additional undergraduate courses to build up the core foundations of computer science may not elect the pass/fail option for th ese courses. 4.1.5 Transfer Credit An equivalent graduate course previously completed at another institution may be permitted to satisfy one of the Ph.D. course requirements. The decision on whether a course may be transferred is made by the Ph.D. Program Direct or. Typically, the student will provide the Program Director with the syllabus of the external course, and the Program Director will use that and the student\u2019s transcript to make the decision. See the section on \u201cDefinition of transfer credit versus cour se exemption .\u201d A student may not receive transfer credit for more than four courses. 4.1.6 Residency Requirements The university requires Ph.D. s to spend at least one year of residency at Carnegie Mellon.

Artificial intelligence, 1955-56\u00a0Can you write a working computer program without a computer? Herb Simon (H\u201990), at left, Allen Newell (IA\u201957), at right, and Cliff Shaw did. The team created the first artificial intelligence program, Logic Theorist, which could solve logic puzzles in the same way that a human might solve them. Newell demonstrated that it worked by writing the instructions on 3-by-5 index cards that were manipulated on the kitchen table by Newell, his wife, and a group of Carnegie Tech grad students.| \nTuring Awards and a Nobel Prize\n\nIn 1975, Simon and Newell were awarded the A.M. Turing Award for their work in artificial intelligence. (As of 2014, 12 CMU alumni or faculty have been awarded Turings, sometimes considered the Nobel Prize of computing.) Three years later, Simon received the Nobel Prize in Economics for his work on decision-making theory. As the 1970s progressed, Newell became interested in human-computer interaction, and began a long relationship with Xerox\u2019s Palo Alto Research Center, or PARC, which released the Xerox Alto in 1973. Considered a forerunner to many of the computing environments that followed, Alto featured a graphical-user interface and was among the first commercially available workstations controlled with a mouse. Inspired by Alto, Reddy launched a drive for development of CMU\u2019s own \u201cthree-M\u201d machine\u2014a personal workstation with a megabyte of memory, a megapixel display and at least one million instructions per second of processing power.\n|Author: Graham Neubig Title: Program-Aided Reasoners (better) Know What They Know Publication year: 2023 Coauthors: Anubha Kabra, Sanketh Rangreji, Yash Mathur, Aman Madaan, Emmy Liu, Graham Neubig Abstract: Prior work shows that program-aided reasoning, in which large language models (LLMs) are combined with programs written in programming languages such as Python, can significantly improve accuracy on various reasoning tasks. However, while accuracy is essential, it is also important for such reasoners to\"know what they know\", which can be quantified through the calibration of the model. In this paper, we compare the calibration of Program Aided Language Models (PAL) and text-based Chain-of-thought (COT) prompting techniques over 5 datasets and 2 model types: LLaMA models and OpenAI models. Our results indicate that PAL leads to improved calibration in 75% of the instances. Our analysis uncovers that prompting styles that produce lesser diversity in generations also have more calibrated results, and thus we also experiment with inducing lower generation diversity using temperature scaling and find that for certain temperatures, PAL is not only more accurate but is also more calibrated than COT. Overall, we demonstrate that, in the majority of cases, program-aided reasoners better know what they know than text-based counterparts.|Author: Eric P. Xing Title: Improved Logical Reasoning of Language Models via Differentiable Symbolic Programming Publication year: 2023 Coauthors: Hanlin Zhang, Jiani Huang, Ziyang Li, M. Naik, Eric P. Xing Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LMs) struggle to perform logical reasoning reliably despite advances in scale and compositionality. In this work, we tackle this challenge through the lens of symbolic programming. We propose DSR-LM, a Differentiable Symbolic Reasoning framework where pre-trained LMs govern the perception of factual knowledge, and a symbolic module performs deductive reasoning. In contrast to works that rely on hand-crafted logic rules, our differentiable symbolic reasoning framework efficiently learns weighted rules and applies semantic loss to further improve LMs. DSR-LM is scalable, interpretable, and allows easy integration of prior knowledge, thereby supporting extensive symbolic programming to robustly derive a logical conclusion. The results of our experiments suggest that DSR-LM improves the logical reasoning abilities of pre-trained language models, resulting in a significant increase in accuracy of over 20% on deductive reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, DSR-LM outperforms a variety of competitive baselines when faced with systematic changes in sequence length.|Author: Eric P.

Waibel Title: Convoifilter: A case study of doing cocktail party speech recognition Publication year: 2023 Coauthors: T. Nguyen, A. Waibel Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end model designed to improve automatic speech recognition (ASR) for a particular speaker in a crowded, noisy environment. The model utilizes a single-channel speech enhancement module that isolates the speaker's voice from background noise (ConVoiFilter) and an ASR module. The model can decrease ASR's word error rate (WER) from 80% to 26.4% through this approach. Typically, these two components are adjusted independently due to variations in data requirements. However, speech enhancement can create anomalies that decrease ASR efficiency. By implementing a joint fine-tuning strategy, the model can reduce the WER from 26.4% in separate tuning to 14.5% in joint tuning. We openly share our pre-trained model to foster further research hf.co/nguyenvulebinh/voice-filter.|23.

Typical errors include acronyms, named entities and domain-specific special words for which little or no data is available. To address the problem of recognizing these words, we propose an self-supervised continual learning approach. Given the audio of a lecture talk with corresponding slides, we bias the model towards decoding new words from the slides by using a memory-enhanced ASR model from previous work. Then, we perform inference on the talk, collecting utterances that contain detected new words into an adaptation dataset. Continual learning is then performed on this set by adapting low-rank matrix weights added to each weight matrix of the model. The whole procedure is iterated for many talks. We show that with this approach, we obtain increasing performance on the new words when they occur more frequently (more than 80% recall) while preserving the general performance of the model.|Author: Shinji Watanabe Title: Decoder-only Architecture for Speech Recognition with CTC Prompts and Text Data Augmentation Publication year: 2023 Coauthors: E. Tsunoo, Hayato Futami, Yosuke Kashiwagi, Siddhant Arora, Shinji Watanabe Abstract: Collecting audio-text pairs is expensive; however, it is much easier to access text-only data. Unless using shallow fusion, end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) models require architecture modifications or additional training schemes to use text-only data. Inspired by recent advances in decoder-only language models (LMs), such as GPT-3 and PaLM adopted for speech-processing tasks, we propose using a decoder-only architecture for ASR with simple text augmentation. To provide audio information, encoder features compressed by CTC prediction are used as prompts for the decoder, which can be regarded as refining CTC prediction using the decoder-only model. Because the decoder architecture is the same as an autoregressive LM, it is simple to enhance the model by leveraging external text data with LM training. An experimental comparison using LibriSpeech and Switchboard shows that our proposed models with text augmentation training reduced word error rates from ordinary CTC by 0.3% and 1.4% on LibriSpeech test-clean and testother set, respectively, and 2.9% and 5.0% on Switchboard and CallHome. The proposed model had advantage on computational efficiency compared with conventional encoder-decoder ASR models with a similar parameter setup, and outperformed them on the LibriSpeech 100h and Switchboard training scenarios.|Author: Alexander I. Rudnicky Title: A Vector Quantized Approach for Text to Speech Synthesis on Real-World Spontaneous Speech Publication year: 2023 Coauthors: Li-Wei Chen, Shinji Watanabe, Alexander I. Rudnicky Abstract: Recent Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems trained on reading or acted corpora have achieved near human-level naturalness. The diversity of human speech, however, often goes beyond the coverage of these corpora. We believe the ability to handle such diversity is crucial for AI systems to achieve human-level communication. Our work explores the use of more abundant real-world data for building speech synthesizers. We train TTS systems using real-world speech from YouTube and podcasts. We observe the mismatch between training and inference alignments in mel-spectrogram based autoregressive models, leading to unintelligible synthesis, and demonstrate that learned discrete codes within multiple code groups effectively resolves this issue. We introduce our MQTTS system whose architecture is designed for multiple code generation and monotonic alignment, along with the use of a clean silence prompt to improve synthesis quality. We conduct ablation analyses to identify the efficacy of our methods. We show that MQTTS outperforms existing TTS systems in several objective and subjective measures.",

While the next few years will be a time of hard work and intense concentration, we hope that your time at the LTI will also be rewarding professionally and personally. Obtaining a Ph.D. is a long and often intense journey. A healthy work-life balance helps to keep it in perspective. Carnegie Mellon is located in Pittsburgh, a city with a rich industrial and labor heritage. In the past, it was the heart of the U.S. steel industry, a source for quality packaged foods, an important financial hub, and an early pioneer in railroads, radio, and nuclear power. This is a city where people worked hard and made things that changed the world. Today, Pittsburgh has reinvented itself as a leader in Computer Science and medicine, but it is still a place where people work hard and make things that change the world . It is also an informal city, where people don\u2019t take themselves too seriously and remember to have fun. It is home to excellent museums, competitive professional sports teams, inexpensive magic shows, and free music during the summer, with skiing and magnificent state parks nearby. Your stay here will be more rewarding if you make time for e xploring the many activities that Pittsburgh and Southwest Pennsylvania have to offer.

Publication year: 2023 Coauthors: A. Luccioni, Yacine Jernite, Emma Strubell Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in the popularity of commercial AI products based on generative, multi-purpose AI systems promising a unified approach to building machine learning (ML) models into technology. However, this ambition of\"generality\"comes at a steep cost to the environment, given the amount of energy these systems require and the amount of carbon that they emit. In this work, we propose the first systematic comparison of the ongoing inference cost of various categories of ML systems, covering both task-specific (i.e. finetuned models that carry out a single task) and `general-purpose' models, (i.e. those trained for multiple tasks). We measure deployment cost as the amount of energy and carbon required to perform 1,000 inferences on representative benchmark dataset using these models. We find that multi-purpose, generative architectures are orders of magnitude more expensive than task-specific systems for a variety of tasks, even when controlling for the number of model parameters. We conclude with a discussion around the current trend of deploying multi-purpose generative ML systems, and caution that their utility should be more intentionally weighed against increased costs in terms of energy and emissions. All the data from our study can be accessed via an interactive demo to carry out further exploration and analysis.|6.

The prompts used by companies to guide their models are often treated as secrets, to be hidden from the user making the query. They have even been treated as commodities to be bought and sold. However, anecdotal reports have shown adversarial users employing prompt extraction attacks to recover these prompts. In this paper, we present a framework for systematically measuring the effectiveness of these attacks. In experiments with 3 different sources of prompts and 11 underlying large language models, we find that simple text-based attacks can in fact reveal prompts with high probability. Our framework determines with high precision whether an extracted prompt is the actual secret prompt, rather than a model hallucination. Prompt extraction experiments on real systems such as Bing Chat and ChatGPT suggest that system prompts can be revealed by an adversary despite existing defenses in place.|Author: A. Waibel Title: AdapITN: A Fast, Reliable, and Dynamic Adaptive Inverse Text Normalization Publication year: 2023 Coauthors: T. Nguyen, Le Duc Minh Nhat, Quang Minh Nguyen, Quoc Truong Do, C. Luong, A. Waibel Abstract: Inverse text normalization (ITN) is the task that transforms text in spoken-form into written-form. While automatic speech recognition (ASR) produces text in spoken-form, human and natural language understanding systems prefer to consume text in written-form. ITN generally deals with semiotic phrases (e.g., numbers, date, time). However, lack of studies to deal with phonetization phrases, which is ASR\u2019s output when it handles unseen data (e.g., foreign-named entities, domain names), although these exist in the same form in the spoken-form text. The reason is that phonetization phrases are infinite patterns and language-dependent. In this study, we introduce a novel end2end model that can handle both semiotic phrases (SEP) and phonetization phrases (PHP), named AdapITN. We call it \"Adap\" because it allows for handling unseen PHP. The model performs only when necessary by providing a mechanism to narrow normalized regions and external query knowledge, reducing the runtime significantly.|Author: Daniel Fried Title: SantaCoder: don't reach for the stars!

MARVEL encodes queries and multi-modal documents with a unified encoder model, which helps to alleviate the modality gap between images and texts. Specifically, we enable the image understanding ability of the well-trained dense retriever, T5-ANCE, by incorporating the visual module's encoded image features as its inputs. To facilitate the multi-modal retrieval tasks, we build the ClueWeb22-MM dataset based on the ClueWeb22 dataset, which regards anchor texts as queries, and exacts the related text and image documents from anchor-linked web pages. Our experiments show that MARVEL significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the multi-modal retrieval dataset WebQA and ClueWeb22-MM. MARVEL provides an opportunity to broaden the advantages of text retrieval to the multi-model scenario. Besides, we also illustrate that the language model has the ability to extract image semantics and partly map the image features to the input word embedding space.

Salakhutdinov, A. Azaria, Tom M. Mitchell, Yuan-Fang Li Abstract: Open-world survival games pose significant challenges for AI algorithms due to their multi-tasking, deep exploration, and goal prioritization requirements. Despite reinforcement learning (RL) being popular for solving games, its high sample complexity limits its effectiveness in complex open-world games like Crafter or Minecraft. We propose a novel approach, SPRING, to read the game's original academic paper and use the knowledge learned to reason and play the game through a large language model (LLM). Prompted with the LaTeX source as game context and a description of the agent's current observation, our SPRING framework employs a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with game-related questions as nodes and dependencies as edges. We identify the optimal action to take in the environment by traversing the DAG and calculating LLM responses for each node in topological order, with the LLM's answer to final node directly translating to environment actions. In our experiments, we study the quality of in-context\"reasoning\"induced by different forms of prompts under the setting of the Crafter open-world environment. Our experiments suggest that LLMs, when prompted with consistent chain-of-thought, have great potential in completing sophisticated high-level trajectories. Quantitatively, SPRING with GPT-4 outperforms all state-of-the-art RL baselines, trained for 1M steps, without any training. Finally, we show the potential of games as a test bed for LLMs.|Author: Graham Neubig Title: SOTOPIA: Interactive Evaluation for Social Intelligence in Language Agents Publication year: 2023 Coauthors: Xuhui Zhou, Hao Zhu, Leena Mathur, Ruohong Zhang, Haofei Yu, Zhengyang Qi, Louis-Philippe Morency, Yonatan Bisk, Daniel Fried, Graham Neubig, Maarten Sap Abstract: Humans are social beings; we pursue social goals in our daily interactions, which is a crucial aspect of social intelligence. Yet, AI systems' abilities in this realm remain elusive. We present SOTOPIA, an open-ended environment to simulate complex social interactions between artificial agents and evaluate their social intelligence. In our environment, agents role-play and interact under a wide variety of scenarios; they coordinate, collaborate, exchange, and compete with each other to achieve complex social goals. We simulate the role-play interaction between LLM-based agents and humans within this task space and evaluate their performance with a holistic evaluation framework called SOTOPIA-Eval. With SOTOPIA, we find significant differences between these models in terms of their social intelligence, and we identify a subset of SOTOPIA scenarios, SOTOPIA-hard, that is generally challenging for all models. We find that on this subset, GPT-4 achieves a significantly lower goal completion rate than humans and struggles to exhibit social commonsense reasoning and strategic communication skills. These findings demonstrate SOTOPIA's promise as a general platform for research on evaluating and improving social intelligence in artificial agents.|Author: Graham Neubig Title: EXCALIBUR: Encouraging and Evaluating Embodied Exploration Publication year: 2023 Coauthors: Hao Zhu, Raghav Kapoor, So Yeon Min, Winson Han, Jiatai Li, Kaiwen Geng, Graham Neubig, Yonatan Bisk, Aniruddha Kembhavi, Luca Weihs Abstract: Experience precedes understanding. Humans constantly explore and learn about their environment out of curiosity, gather information, and update their models of the world. On the other hand, machines are either trained to learn passively from static and fixed datasets, or taught to complete specific goal-conditioned tasks. To encourage the development of exploratory interactive agents, we present the EXCALIBUR benchmark. EXCALIBUR allows agents to explore their environment for long durations and then query their understanding of the physical world via inquiries like: \u201cis the small heavy red bowl made from glass?\u201d or \u201cis there a silver spoon heavier than the egg?\u201d. This design encourages agents to perform free-form home exploration without myopia induced by goal conditioning. Once the agents have answered a series of questions, they can renter the scene to refine their knowledge, update their beliefs, and improve their performance on the questions. Our experiments demonstrate the challenges posed by this dataset for the present-day state-of-the-art embodied systems and the headroom afforded to develop new innovative methods. Finally, we present a virtual reality interface that enables humans to seamlessly interact within the simulated world and use it to gather human performance measures. EXCALIBUR affords unique challenges in comparison to presentday benchmarks and represents the next frontier for embodied AI research.|Author: Graham Neubig Title: WebArena: A Realistic Web Environment for Building Autonomous Agents Publication year: 2023 Coauthors: Shuyan Zhou, Frank F. Xu, Hao Zhu, Xuhui Zhou, Robert Lo, Abishek Sridhar, Xianyi Cheng, Yonatan Bisk, Daniel Fried, Uri Alon, Graham Neubig Abstract: With advances in generative AI, there is now potential for autonomous agents to manage daily tasks via natural language commands. However, current agents are primarily created and tested in simplified synthetic environments, leading to a disconnect with real-world scenarios. In this paper, we build an environment for language-guided agents that is highly realistic and reproducible. Specifically, we focus on agents that perform tasks on the web, and create an environment with fully functional websites from four common domains: e-commerce, social forum discussions, collaborative software development, and content management. Our environment is enriched with tools (e.g., a map) and external knowledge bases (e.g., user manuals) to encourage human-like task-solving. Building upon our environment, we release a set of benchmark tasks focusing on evaluating the functional correctness of task completions. The tasks in our benchmark are diverse, long-horizon, and designed to emulate tasks that humans routinely perform on the internet. We experiment with several baseline agents, integrating recent techniques such as reasoning before acting. The results demonstrate that solving complex tasks is challenging: our best GPT-4-based agent only achieves an end-to-end task success rate of 14.41%, significantly lower than the human performance of 78.24%. These results highlight the need for further development of robust agents, that current state-of-the-art large language models are far from perfect performance in these real-life tasks, and that WebArena can be used to measure such progress.|What\u2019s so great about computer science at Carnegie Mellon?We're glad you asked!

Hughes, Daniel Fried, Arjun Guha, Harm de Vries, Leandro von Werra Abstract: The BigCode project is an open-scientific collaboration working on the responsible development of large language models for code. This tech report describes the progress of the collaboration until December 2022, outlining the current state of the Personally Identifiable Information (PII) redaction pipeline, the experiments conducted to de-risk the model architecture, and the experiments investigating better preprocessing methods for the training data. We train 1.1B parameter models on the Java, JavaScript, and Python subsets of The Stack and evaluate them on the MultiPL-E text-to-code benchmark. We find that more aggressive filtering of near-duplicates can further boost performance and, surprisingly, that selecting files from repositories with 5+ GitHub stars deteriorates performance significantly. Our best model outperforms previous open-source multilingual code generation models (InCoder-6.7B and CodeGen-Multi-2.7B) in both left-to-right generation and infilling on the Java, JavaScript, and Python portions of MultiPL-E, despite being a substantially smaller model. All models are released under an OpenRAIL license at https://hf.co/bigcode.|Author: Jamie Callan Title: Multi-Objective Improvement of Android Applications Publication year: 2023 Coauthors: Jamie Callan, J. Petke Abstract: Non-functional properties, such as runtime or memory use, are important to mobile app users and developers, as they affect user experience. Previous work on automated improvement of non-functional properties in mobile apps failed to address the inherent trade-offs between such properties. We propose a practical approach and the first open-source tool, GIDroid (2023), for multi-objective automated improvement of Android apps. In particular, we use Genetic improvement, a search-based technique that navigates the space of software variants to find improved software. We use a simulation-based testing framework to greatly improve the speed of search. GIDroid contains three state-of-the-art multi-objective algorithms, and two new mutation operators, which cache the results of method calls. Genetic improvement relies on testing to validate patches. Previous work showed that tests in open-source Android applications are scarce. We thus wrote tests for 21 versions of 7 Android apps, creating a new benchmark for performance improvements. We used GIDroid to improve versions of mobile apps where developers had previously found improvements to runtime, memory, and bandwidth use. Our technique automatically re-discovers 64% of existing improvements. We then applied our approach to current versions of software in which there were no known improvements. We were able to improve execution time by up to 35%, and memory use by up to 33% in these apps.",

Despite reinforcement learning (RL) being popular for solving games, its high sample complexity limits its effectiveness in complex open-world games like Crafter or Minecraft. We propose a novel approach, SPRING, to read the game's original academic paper and use the knowledge learned to reason and play the game through a large language model (LLM). Prompted with the LaTeX source as game context and a description of the agent's current observation, our SPRING framework employs a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with game-related questions as nodes and dependencies as edges. We identify the optimal action to take in the environment by traversing the DAG and calculating LLM responses for each node in topological order, with the LLM's answer to final node directly translating to environment actions. In our experiments, we study the quality of in-context\"reasoning\"induced by different forms of prompts under the setting of the Crafter open-world environment. Our experiments suggest that LLMs, when prompted with consistent chain-of-thought, have great potential in completing sophisticated high-level trajectories. Quantitatively, SPRING with GPT-4 outperforms all state-of-the-art RL baselines, trained for 1M steps, without any training. Finally, we show the potential of games as a test bed for LLMs.|Author: Mona T. Diab Title: OPT-R: Exploring the Role of Explanations in Finetuning and Prompting for Reasoning Skills of Large Language Models Publication year: 2023 Coauthors: Badr AlKhamissi, Siddharth Verma, Ping Yu, Zhijing Jin, Asli Celikyilmaz, Mona T. Diab Abstract: We conduct a thorough investigation into the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing specifically on the Open Pretrained Transformers (OPT) models as a representative of such models. Our study entails finetuning three different sizes of OPT on a carefully curated reasoning corpus, resulting in two sets of finetuned models: OPT-R, finetuned without explanations, and OPT-RE, finetuned with explanations. We then evaluate all models on 57 out-of-domain tasks drawn from the Super-NaturalInstructions benchmark, covering 26 distinct reasoning skills, utilizing three prompting techniques. Through a comprehensive grid of 27 configurations and 6,156 test evaluations, we investigate the dimensions of finetuning, prompting, and scale to understand the role of explanations on different reasoning skills. Our findings reveal that having explanations in the fewshot exemplar has no significant impact on the model\u2019s performance when the model is finetuned, while positively affecting the non-finetuned counterpart. Moreover, we observe a slight yet consistent increase in classification accuracy as we incorporate explanations during prompting and finetuning, respectively. Finally, we offer insights on which reasoning skills benefit the most from incorporating explanations during finetuning and prompting, such as Numerical (+20.4%) and Analogical (+13.9%) reasoning, as well as skills that exhibit negligible or negative effects.|Author: Yiming Yang Title: In-Context Principle Learning from Mistakes Publication year: 2024 Coauthors: Tianjun Zhang, Aman Madaan, Luyu Gao, Steven Zheng, Swaroop Mishra, Yiming Yang, Niket Tandon, Uri Alon Abstract: In-context learning (ICL, also known as few-shot prompting) has been the standard method of adapting LLMs to downstream tasks, by learning from a few input-output examples. Nonetheless, all ICL-based approaches only learn from correct input-output pairs. In this paper, we revisit this paradigm, by learning more from the few given input-output examples. We introduce Learning Principles (LEAP): First, we intentionally induce the model to make mistakes on these few examples; then we reflect on these mistakes, and learn explicit task-specific\"principles\"from them, which help solve similar problems and avoid common mistakes; finally, we prompt the model to answer unseen test questions using the original few-shot examples and these learned general principles. We evaluate LEAP on a wide range of benchmarks, including multi-hop question answering (Hotpot QA), textual QA (DROP), Big-Bench Hard reasoning, and math problems (GSM8K and MATH); in all these benchmarks, LEAP improves the strongest available LLMs such as GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, GPT-4 turbo and Claude-2.1. For example, LEAP improves over the standard few-shot prompting using GPT-4 by 7.5% in DROP, and by 3.3% in HotpotQA. Importantly, LEAP does not require any more input or examples than the standard few-shot prompting settings.|Author: Yonatan Bisk Title: Computational Language Acquisition with Theory of Mind Publication year: 2023 Coauthors: Andy T. Liu, Hao Zhu, Emmy Liu, Yonatan Bisk, Graham Neubig Abstract: Unlike current state-of-the-art language models, young children actively acquire language through interactions with their surrounding environment and caretakers. One mechanism that has been argued to be critical to language learning is the ability to infer the mental states of other agents in social environments, coined Theory of Mind (ToM) by Premack&Woodruff (1978). Drawing inspiration from the modern operationalized versions of ToM implemented in Rabinowitz et al. (2018) and Zhu et al. (2021), we build language-learning agents equipped with ToM, and measure its effects on the learning process. We model ToM by giving the speaker agent an internal listener model that is trained alongside the speaker and used to rerank potential utterances. We experiment with varying task difficulty, hypothesizing that models will acquire more complex language to adapt to stronger environmental pressures. We find that training speakers with a highly weighted ToM listener component leads to performance gains in our image referential game setting. We also find some evidence that increasing task difficulty in the training process results in more fluent and precise utterances in evaluation. This suggests the potential utility of further incorporating ToM, as well as other insights from child language acquisition, into computational models of language acquisition.|Author: Graham Neubig Title: Computational Language Acquisition with Theory of Mind Publication year: 2023 Coauthors: Andy T.

Liang, R. Salakhutdinov, Louis-Philippe Morency Abstract: Multimodal machine learning, which studies the information and interactions across various input modalities, has made significant advancements in understanding the relationship between images and descriptive text. However, this is just a portion of the potential multimodal interactions seen in the real world and does not include new interactions between conflicting utterances and gestures in predicting sarcasm, for example. Notably, the current methods for capturing shared information often do not extend well to these more nuanced interactions, sometimes performing as low as 50% in binary classification. In this paper, we address this problem via a new approach called MMOE, which stands for a mixture of multimodal interaction experts. Our method automatically classifies data points from unlabeled multimodal datasets by their interaction type and employs specialized models for each specific interaction. Based on our experiments, this approach improves performance on these challenging interactions by more than 10%, leading to an overall increase of 2% for tasks like sarcasm prediction. As a result, interaction quantification provides new insights for dataset analysis and yields simple approaches that obtain state-of-the-art performance.|Author: Louis-Philippe Morency Title: Continual Learning for Personalized Co-Speech Gesture Generation Publication year: 2023 Coauthors: Chaitanya Ahuja, Pratik Joshi, Ryo Ishii, Louis-Philippe Morency Abstract: Co-speech gestures are a key channel of human communication, making them important for personalized chat agents to generate. In the past, gesture generation models assumed that data for each speaker is available all at once, and in large amounts. However in practical scenarios, speaker data comes sequentially and in small amounts as the agent personalizes with more speakers, akin to a continual learning paradigm. While more recent works have shown progress in adapting to low-resource data, they catastrophically forget the gesture styles of initial speakers they were trained on. Also, prior generative continual learning works are not multimodal, making this space less studied. In this paper, we explore this new paradigm and propose C-DiffGAN: an approach that continually learns new speaker gesture styles with only a few minutes of per-speaker data, while retaining previously learnt styles. Inspired by prior continual learning works, C-DiffGAN encourages knowledge retention by 1) generating reminiscences of previous low-resource speaker data, then 2) crossmodally aligning to them to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. We quantitatively demonstrate improved performance and reduced forgetting over strong baselines through standard continual learning measures, reinforced by a qualitative user study that shows that our method produces more natural, style-preserving gestures.

For example, the word \u201ccosmopolitan\u201d in a sentence such as \u201cwe need to end the cosmopolitan experiment\u201d can mean \u201cworldly\u201d to many but also secretly mean \u201cJewish\u201d to a select few. We present the first large-scale computational investigation of dogwhistles. We develop a typology of dogwhistles, curate the largest-to-date glossary of over 300 dogwhistles with rich contextual information and examples, and analyze their usage in historical U.S. politicians\u2019 speeches. We then assess whether a large language model (GPT-3) can identify dogwhistles and their meanings, and find that GPT-3\u2019s performance varies widely across types of dogwhistles and targeted groups. Finally, we show that harmful content containing dogwhistles avoids toxicity detection, highlighting online risks presented by such coded language. This work sheds light on the theoretical and applied importance of dogwhistles in both NLP and computational social science, and provides resources to facilitate future research in modeling dogwhistles and mitigating their online harms.|Author: Louis-Philippe Morency Title: Expanding the Role of Affective Phenomena in Multimodal Interaction Research Publication year: 2023 Coauthors: Leena Mathur, Maja J Matari'c, Louis-Philippe Morency Abstract: In recent decades, the field of affective computing has made substantial progress in advancing the ability of AI systems to recognize and express affective phenomena, such as affect and emotions, during human-human and human-machine interactions. This paper describes our examination of research at the intersection of multimodal interaction and affective computing, with the objective of observing trends and identifying understudied areas. We examined over 16,000 papers from selected conferences in multimodal interaction, affective computing, and natural language processing: ACM International Conference on Multimodal Interaction, AAAC International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction, Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, and Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing. We identified 910 affect-related papers and present our analysis of the role of affective phenomena in these papers. We find that this body of research has primarily focused on enabling machines to recognize or express affect and emotion; there has been limited research on how affect and emotion predictions might, in turn, be used by AI systems to enhance machine understanding of human social behaviors and cognitive states. Based on our analysis, we discuss directions to expand the role of affective phenomena in multimodal interaction research.",

The faculty do not burden the students with numerous rules, and, in return, we expect the students to not try to find technical loopholes that violate the clear intent of program policies. In any situa tion not covered by an ex plicit rule, you should ask yourself how reasonable people would behave in that situation.

Recent research has hinted in the affirmative, finding that brain signals can be effectively predicted using the internal representations of language models (LMs). Although such results are thought to reflect shared computational principles between LMs and human brains, there are also clear differences in how LMs and humans represent and use language. In this work, we systematically explore the divergences between human and machine language processing by examining the differences between LM representations and human brain responses to language as measured by Magnetoencephalography (MEG) across two datasets in which subjects read and listened to narrative stories. Using a data-driven approach, we identify two domains that are not captured well by LMs: social/emotional intelligence and physical commonsense. We then validate these domains with human behavioral experiments and show that fine-tuning LMs on these domains can improve their alignment with human brain responses.|Author: Maarten Sap Title: Clever Hans or Neural Theory of Mind? Stress Testing Social Reasoning in Large Language Models Publication year: 2023 Coauthors: Natalie Shapira, Mosh Levy, S. Alavi, Xuhui Zhou, Yejin Choi, Yoav Goldberg, Maarten Sap, Vered Shwartz Abstract: The escalating debate on AI's capabilities warrants developing reliable metrics to assess machine\"intelligence\". Recently, many anecdotal examples were used to suggest that newer large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and GPT-4 exhibit Neural Theory-of-Mind (N-ToM); however, prior work reached conflicting conclusions regarding those abilities. We investigate the extent of LLMs' N-ToM through an extensive evaluation on 6 tasks and find that while LLMs exhibit certain N-ToM abilities, this behavior is far from being robust. We further examine the factors impacting performance on N-ToM tasks and discover that LLMs struggle with adversarial examples, indicating reliance on shallow heuristics rather than robust ToM abilities. We caution against drawing conclusions from anecdotal examples, limited benchmark testing, and using human-designed psychological tests to evaluate models.|Yonatan Bisk Assistant Professor Email: ybisk@cs.cmu.edu Office: Gates & Hillman Centers Research Areas: Grounding, RoboNLP, Vision and Language, Embodiment, Unsupervised Learning|Ralf Brown Principal Systems Scientist Email: ralf@andrew.cmu.edu Office: 5711 Gates & Hillman Centers Phone: 412-268-8298 Research Areas: Information Extraction, Summarization and Question Answering, Information Retrieval, Text Mining and Analytics, Machine Translation, Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics|in neuroscience, is social chair for Fringe.

It was arguably the first college devoted solely to computer science in the United States, and a model for others that followed. But CMU\u2019s computer science era begins much earlier\u2014in 1956, with the arrival of an IBM 650 computer on the campus of what was then known as Carnegie Institute of Technology. The IBM 650 had magnetic-drum memory and a processing speed of approximately 60 instructions per second. Herb Simon (H\u201990), associate dean of the Graduate School of Industrial Administration\u2014now known as CMU\u2019s Tepper School of Business\u2014established Carnegie Tech\u2019s first Computation Center with the help of its first director, Alan Perlis (S\u201942).\n",

Mortensen, Graham Neubig Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) implicitly learn to perform a range of language tasks, including machine translation (MT). Previous studies explore aspects of LLMs\u2019 MT capabilities. However, there exist a wide variety of languages for which recent LLM MT performance has never before been evaluated. Without published experimental evidence on the matter, it is difficult for speakers of the world\u2019s diverse languages to know how and whether they can use LLMs for their languages. We present the first experimental evidence for an expansive set of 204 languages, along with MT cost analysis, using the FLORES-200 benchmark. Trends reveal that GPT models approach or exceed traditional MT model performance for some high-resource languages (HRLs) but consistently lag for low-resource languages (LRLs), under-performing traditional MT for 84.1% of languages we covered. Our analysis reveals that a language\u2019s resource level is the most important feature in determining ChatGPT\u2019s relative ability to translate it, and suggests that ChatGPT is especially disadvantaged for LRLs and African languages.|Author: Graham Neubig Title: ChatGPT MT: Competitive for High- (but Not Low-) Resource Languages Publication year: 2023 Coauthors: Nathaniel R.

Bhatnagar, Graham Neubig, Ngoc Thang Vu, Katharina Kann Abstract: Neural models have drastically advanced state of the art for machine translation (MT) between high-resource languages. Traditionally, these models rely on large amounts of training data, but many language pairs lack these resources. However, an important part of the languages in the world do not have this amount of data. Most languages from the Americas are among them, having a limited amount of parallel and monolingual data, if any. Here, we present an introduction to the interested reader to the basic challenges, concepts, and techniques that involve the creation of MT systems for these languages. Finally, we discuss the recent advances and findings and open questions, product of an increased interest of the NLP community in these languages.|Author: Graham Neubig Title: The Devil Is in the Errors: Leveraging Large Language Models for Fine-grained Machine Translation Evaluation Publication year: 2023 Coauthors: Patrick Fernandes, Daniel Deutsch, M. Finkelstein, Parker Riley, Andr\u00e9 F. T. Martins, Graham Neubig, Ankush Garg, J. Clark, Markus Freitag, Orhan Firat Abstract: Automatic evaluation of machine translation (MT) is a critical tool driving the rapid iterative development of MT systems. While considerable progress has been made on estimating a single scalar quality score, current metrics lack the informativeness of more detailed schemes that annotate individual errors, such as Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM). In this paper, we help fill this gap by proposing AutoMQM, a prompting technique which leverages the reasoning and in-context learning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and asks them to identify and categorize errors in translations. We start by evaluating recent LLMs, such as PaLM and PaLM-2, through simple score prediction prompting, and we study the impact of labeled data through in-context learning and finetuning. We then evaluate AutoMQM with PaLM-2 models, and we find that it improves performance compared to just prompting for scores (with particularly large gains for larger models) while providing interpretability through error spans that align with human annotations.|Lori Levin Research Professor Email: lsl@cs.cmu.edu Office: 5717 Gates & Hillman Centers Phone: 412-268-6193 Research Areas: Machine Translation, Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics, Corpus Annotation and Resources",

For example, the word \u201ccosmopolitan\u201d in a sentence such as \u201cwe need to end the cosmopolitan experiment\u201d can mean \u201cworldly\u201d to many but also secretly mean \u201cJewish\u201d to a select few. We present the first large-scale computational investigation of dogwhistles. We develop a typology of dogwhistles, curate the largest-to-date glossary of over 300 dogwhistles with rich contextual information and examples, and analyze their usage in historical U.S. politicians\u2019 speeches. We then assess whether a large language model (GPT-3) can identify dogwhistles and their meanings, and find that GPT-3\u2019s performance varies widely across types of dogwhistles and targeted groups. Finally, we show that harmful content containing dogwhistles avoids toxicity detection, highlighting online risks presented by such coded language. This work sheds light on the theoretical and applied importance of dogwhistles in both NLP and computational social science, and provides resources to facilitate future research in modeling dogwhistles and mitigating their online harms.|6.

Modern AA leverages an author's consistent writing style to match a text to its author using an AA classifier. AO is the corresponding adversarial task, aiming to modify a text in such a way that its semantics are preserved, yet an AA model cannot correctly infer its authorship. To address privacy concerns raised by state-of-the-art (SOTA) AA methods, new AO methods have been proposed but remain largely impractical to use due to their prohibitively slow training and obfuscation speed, often taking hours. To this challenge, we propose a practical AO method, ALISON, that (1) dramatically reduces training/obfuscation time, demonstrating more than 10x faster obfuscation than SOTA AO methods, (2) achieves better obfuscation success through attacking three transformer-based AA methods on two benchmark datasets, typically performing 15% better than competing methods, (3) does not require direct signals from a target AA classifier during obfuscation, and (4) utilizes unique stylometric features, allowing sound model interpretation for explainable obfuscation. We also demonstrate that ALISON can effectively prevent four SOTA AA methods from accurately determining the authorship of ChatGPT-generated texts, all while minimally changing the original text semantics. To ensure the reproducibility of our findings, our code and data are available at: https://github.com/EricX003/ALISON.",

It can be contacted at help@cs.cmu.edu , extension 8-4231 from a campus phone, or 412-268-4231 from an outside line (M-F, 9am-5pm) . 3 Standard Degree Requirements & Degree Certification 3.1 LTI Ph.D. Degree Requirements To complete the Ph.D. in Language and Information Technologies degree, the student must satisfy the following requirements: \u2022 Pass at least 96 units of graduate level courses, with additional requirements detailed below ; \u2022 Satisfy proficiencies in Writing, Presentation, Programming, and Teaching ; \u2022 Propose , write, and defend a Ph.D. dissertation (thesis) ; \u2022 Attend the LTI Colloquium (11-700) each semester ; and \u2022 Satisfy the Research Speaking Requirement. The sections below provide more detail about each of these requirements. 3.1.1 Course Requirements To complete the course requirements for the Ph.D. in Language and Information Technologies degree, the student must pass 96 or more course units of graduate courses, and meet the following criteria: \u2022 At least 72 units of \u201cLTI\u201d courses and 24 units of \u201cSCS\u201d courses, \u2022 At least one class in each \u201cLTI Focus Area\u201d, and \u2022 At least two labs, in two different research areas . For definitions of quoted terms, see the section on \u201cDefinitions of LTI Terminology\u201d. Unless approved by the Program Director in advance, the course requirements must be satisfied by actual classroom courses, not credit given for research or independent study. An \u201cLTI course \u201d is any 12-unit course with a number of 11-XXX; a 6-unit course with 11-XXX counts as one-half of an LTI course. Unless otherwise specified, \"course\" means an actual classroom course, not credit given for research or independent study. Note that the LTI allow s any one MLD (10-XXX) graduate course to count as an \"LTI course\". An \u201cSCS course\u201d is any 12-unit course with a course number indicating a unit of the School of Computer Science (including LTI); a 6-unit course with such a number counts as one-half of an SCS course. Unless otherwise specified, \"course\" means an actual classroom course, not credit given for research or independent study. Note: Recommended electives that are technically|LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook Page 15 outside of the SCS now count towards this requirement; for example, Digital Signal Processing in ECE. Please see the Program Director for approval of electives as \u201cSCS.\u201d \u201cLTI Focus Areas\u201d are sets of courses defined on the LTI course webpage under \u201cCourse Categories.\u201d If a student believes a new course should be added to a Focus Area, they should make a request to the Ph.D. Program Director . They will decide, with advice from faculty in the appropriate area, whether it should be in the Focus Area. I f approved , it will be added to the LTI Focus Area webpage. A \u201cTask-Orientation Focus Course \u201d is a course belonging to that LTI Focus Area, as listed on the LTI\u2019s \u201cCourse Categories\u201d webpage. An LTI \u201c lab course \u201d is a course in the list of lab courses defined o n the LTI \u2019s \u201cCourse Categories\u201d webpage . 3.1.2 Grade Requirements Students must demonstrate their mastery of material taught in courses and their success in applying their skills in directed stu dy by satisfying the following grade requirements . Minimum grade: Only courses with a grade of B (3.0) or higher are counted as satisfying a degree requirement. Pass/fail: Pass/fail grades are not permitted for courses and projects used to satisfy a degree requirement. 3.1.3 Proficiency Requirements The LTI Ph.D. does not require any Qualifying Exams. Instead, a LTI Ph.D. student is required to demonstrate proficiency in the following four areas. \u2022 Writing: This is satisfied by producing a peer-reviewed conference paper, or the equivalent (a written report that at least two SCS faculty certify as being of conference-paper quality). \u2022 Presentation: This is satisfied by the oral presentation of a conference paper, or the equivalent (an oral presentation that at least t wo SCS faculty certify as being of conference-talk quality). \u2022 Programming: This is satisfied by demonstrating competence in computer programming of language technology; this is normally satisfied in the course of the student's research and/or project work|LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook Page 25 Note that self-funded Ph.D. students (e.g., those registered for five units while on semester interns hip) are not permitted to receive a partial stipend for the semester of their internship, while full-time LTI-sponsored students are eligible for a partial stipend. All students are caution ed to be aware of potential intellectual property (IP) problems with internships, and to review any IP agreements with their advisors before signing them. It is possible to lose ownership of your ideas. If the student is to receive academic credit for the internship, it must have deliverables from the student commensurate with the number of units, they are taking. This can be in the form of interim and final reports on the experience, presentations in the following semester regarding the experience, assessments of their experience as it relates to their course of study, etc. 4.1.3 Maximum Courseload Ph.D. students are permitted to register for a maximum of 54 units of coursework per semester. 4.1.4 Pass/Fail Grades Pass/fail grades are not permitted for courses used to satisfy a degree requirement. Graduate students who are required to take additional undergraduate courses to build up the core foundations of computer science may not elect the pass/fail option for th ese courses. 4.1.5 Transfer Credit An equivalent graduate course previously completed at another institution may be permitted to satisfy one of the Ph.D. course requirements. The decision on whether a course may be transferred is made by the Ph.D. Program Direct or. Typically, the student will provide the Program Director with the syllabus of the external course, and the Program Director will use that and the student\u2019s transcript to make the decision. See the section on \u201cDefinition of transfer credit versus cour se exemption .\u201d A student may not receive transfer credit for more than four courses. 4.1.6 Residency Requirements The university requires Ph.D. s to spend at least one year of residency at Carnegie Mellon.

The student must apply for the Ph.D. at the usual time . However, students that are already enrolled in an LTI degree program are not required to retake GRE and TOEFL exams or to produce new transcripts from other universities. 4.1.8 Transferring Out of the Ph.D. Program The Ph.D. program doe s not prevent students from transferring to another degree program . A student who is interested in transferring out of the Ph.D. degree program should consult the handbook and Program Director of the desired degree program to learn whether transfers are permitted, and if so, how, and when to request such a transfer. 4.2 LTI Academic Policies 4.2.1 \u201cGrandfather\u201d Policy A student can graduate under the policies in effect at the time that the student entered the program; or, at the student's choice, the student can graduate under policies that are adopted after the student entered the program. If it is not realistic to follow a particular policy exactly, the department may approximate the policy as closely as possible; this situation is rare and typically arises only when a student is enrolled in the program for an extended period of time. 4.2.2 Definition of Transfer Credit vs. Course Exemption The LT I may grant transfer credit or issue an exemption for equivalent graduate courses previously completed at another institution. This decision rests with the director of the particular program. If a student is exempt from a required course due to prior cour ses or experience, the student can replace that course with an open elective. The student does not receive credit for the external course but can take any course that could normally count toward the degree in its place. If a student receives credit for pr ior coursework completed at CMU or elsewhere, the student receives that many units of credit, and the total amount of required coursework is reduced by that amount. 4.2.3 External Employment/Consulting Students funded by LTI research projects are expected to wor k primarily for those projects. Since consulting provides useful experience, students are generally permitted to consult at most one day per seven-day week, with the advisor's consent . International students must also have approval in advance from the Office of International Education (OIE) ; otherwise, they may be in violation of their visa status.

Students are expected to attend the LTI's Orientation (\u201cImmigration Course ,\u201d or IC) lectures, in which faculty describe their interests and areas of expertise, and to be proactive about meeting individually with potential advisors. After meeting with several potential advisors, each student will be asked to indicate a firs t, second, and third choice for advisor. Meanwhile, the potential advisors determine how many new students they can take, and indicate their preferences. Finally, the entire LTI faculty meets as a \u201c Marriage Committee \u201d to determine the best set of matches. Some entering MLT students are prefunded, meaning they have received and accepted a funding letter from a faculty member before the Marriage Process. (Even students who are prefunded must attend the research talks, to become acquainted with the LTI\u2019s rese arch projects.) Even self-supporting MLT students are expected to perform research with a faculty advisor, since research experience is an important part of our graduate programs. Until a student finds a specific advisor, the chair of the LTI graduate prog rams serves as the advisor. How to change advisors: The initial advisor selection should be made carefully. However, it is possible to change advisors. To do so, the student should find another faculty member willing to serve as an advisor, and then make a request to the Program Director to switch advisors. The LTI follows the long-standing SCS policy that both the new and old advisors need to agree to the change; typically, this is not a problem ( assuming the new advisor has agreed in advance, as described here ). It is to the student's advantage to avoid switching advisors, especially late in their graduate studies, because forging a strong student-advisor relationship takes time. 4.3 Optional Masters\u2019 Thesis MLT students may optionally elect to complete a Mast ers\u2019 Thesis; it is not required. Students who intend to apply for the PhD program should consider the MLT Thesis as one of several ways to demonstrate their research potential. Other possibilities include innovative research in a research project or class project work. The MLT Thesis must be completed according to the following guidelines. Note in particular the October 31 proposal deadline! \u2022 There are two course components required for students who elect to complete the M.S. Thesis: 11-928 \u2013 Masters \u2019 Thesis I (with the chosen thesis advisor, typically for 12 units, typically in the Fall of their second year) and 11-929 \u2013 Masters \u2019 Thesis II in the following Spring. \u2022 Each of these two courses counts towards 6 units of MLT-level LTI course credit; if the student goes on to an LTI PhD, the second course (11-929) counts towards one PhD lab requirement. \u2022 The MLT thesis may focus on either a significant research result or a significant implementation of a new technology. The student should work with their adv isor to define an interesting but bounded thesis research project. The MLT thesis culminates in|MLT Graduate Student Handbook Page 22 5.1.7 Transferring Into the MLT Program Transfers into the MLT program are not permitted during a student\u2019s first semester at CMU. Students must begin their study at CMU in the program that admitted them; this is a university policy. Students may request to transfer into the MLT program after completing their first semester. The student must make the request in writing (or email) to the MLT/PhD Admissions Chair. The MLT/PhD Admissions Chair will inform the student about what application materials are required; for example, an explanation of why a transfer is desired, a proposed plan of study, a proposed advisor, and CMU transcripts. Students that are already enrolled in an LTI degree program are not required to retake GRE and TOEFL exams or to produce new transcripts from other universities. The MLT program will conduct an expedited admissions process after receiving such a request. 5.1.8 Transferring Out of the MLT Program The MLT program does not prevent students from transferring to another degree program. Each degree program has its own rules about whether and when transfers into the program are permitted. A student that is interested in transferring out of the MLT degree program should consult the handbook and Pr ogram Director of the desired degree program to learn whether transfers are permitted, and if so, how and when to request such a transfer. 5.1.9 Drop/Add/Withdraw Procedures Students taking undergraduate and Masters\u2019 level courses must follow the procedures and deadlines for adding, dropping, and withdrawing from courses as identified on the academic calendar. Information can be found at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/course-changes.index .

These standards require personal integrity, a commitment to honesty without compromise, as well as truth without equivocation and a willingne ss to place the good of the community above the good of the self. Obligations once un dertaken must be me t, commitments kept. As members of the Carnegie Mellon community , individuals are expected to uphold the standards of the community in a ddition to holding others accountable for said standards. It is rare that the life of a student in an academic community can be so private that it will not affect the community as a whole or that the above standards do not apply. The discovery, advancement, and communicatio n of knowledge are not possible without a commitment to these standards. Creativity cannot exist without acknowledgment of the creativity of others. New knowledge cannot be developed without credit for prior knowledge. Without the ability to trust that these princ iples will be observed, an academic community cannot exist. The commitment of its faculty, staff, and students to these standards contributes to the high respect in which the Carnegie Mellon degree is he ld. Students must not de stroy that respect by|9 creating opportunities for spiritual and religious practice and exploration.

        "context": " To receive the maximum amount of federal financial aid for which they may be eligible, students \nmust enroll each semester in at least 36 units that count toward their current degree level.",
        "retrieved_doc": "133.2 Full-time Status All MCDS students are expected to enroll full-time (at present, there is no option to pursue the degree as a part-time student). To be considered a full-time student, a student must be registered for, and complete, a minimum of 36 units in every Fall and Spring semester. All international students are required by US Federal law to maintain full-time status. Students can have no more than one (1) remote course counting toward the 36 units used to satisfy full-time enrollment. Failure to maintain full-time status will result in loss of a student visa (and, therefore, \u201cpermit of stay\u201d). All students having a Stafford Loan are required to maintain full-time status. 3.3 MCDS Degree Enrollment Process and Related Information 3.3.1 Duration of the degree program The MCDS degree must be completed within five (5) years from the time that the student matriculates into the program. https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of-limitations.html As outlined in the Master\u2019s Students Statute of Limitations (see link above), students will complete all requirements for the master\u2019s degree within a maximum of seven years from original matriculation as a master\u2019s student, or less if required by a more restrictive department, school or college policy. Once this time-to-degree limit has lapsed, the person may resume work towards a master\u2019s degree only if newly admitted to a currently offered master\u2019s degree program under criteria determined by that program. Under extraordinary circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, family or parental leave, or temporary disability, a school or college may, upon the relevant department's recommendation and with the written approval of the dean (or designate), defer the lapse for a period commensurate with the duration of that interruption. Students who are pursuing a master\u2019s degree as part-time students for all semesters of their program, as approved by their program, may also appeal to their program or department for extension of the time to degree limit. 3.3.2 Residency requirements There is no formal residence requirement. However, most courses in the program are taught on campus without an option for distance education. Students enrolled in in-person course sections (IPR) are expected to attend all class meetings in person. 3.3.3 Degree Certification: Course requirements and related policies/protocols|MIIS Graduate Student Handbook Page 14 A MIIS student must complete the following curricular requirements: 1. Qualifying courses: MIIS-16 students must pass 72 units (typically 6 12-unit courses) and MIIS-21 students must complete 96 units (typically 8 12-unit courses) in qualifying master\u2019s courses. A qualifying master\u2019s course is defined as: a. Any graduate course (600-level or higher) offered by the Language Technologies Institute; and b. Any graduate course (600-level or higher) from the list of approved qualifying courses (Section 3. 2.4). 2. Free elective: Students must pass 12 units (typically 1 course) in elective master\u2019s course(s). A free elective is defined as: a. A graduate course (600-level or higher) with content relevant to the MIIS program objectives offered by the School of Computer Science ; and b. A course approved by the student's advisor and the degree Program Director. c. A student may not use the same course to satisfy both a qualifying course requirement and an elective course requirement. 3. Breadth requirements : Students must demonstrate breadth by passing one course in each of the following areas. In addition, MIIS-21 students must take two more LTI courses (24 units total) in one of the following areas of concentration: \u2022 Human language; \u2022 Machine learning; and \u2022 Language technology applications. The department maintains and publishes a list of courses that satisfy each of these requirements (Sections 3. 2.5 \u2013 3.2.7). Some c ourses used to satisfy a breadth requirement can also satisfy qualifying course requirements. A student should get approval from the director for the breadth courses , if not listed below. 4.4 Approved Qualifying Courses Any graduate course (600-level or higher) offered by the Language Technologies Institute is a qualifying course. Any two graduate courses (600-level or higher) offered by departments within the SCS relevant to the MIIS degree other than LTI (Machine Learning or Computer Science departments, etc.) may be counted as approved qualifying courses |12granting program or department to determine if early degree certification is allowed and under what circumstances. Extended or Longer-than-Standard Completion Longer-than-standard degree completion may occur due to academic interruptions in making progress toward the degree as defined by the academic program, interruptions of full-time study or progress towards the degree due to serious, documented medical issues, or other unusual or unforeseen circumstances. Master\u2019s students who require longer than the standard time to complete their degree requirements are expected to remain in close contact with their graduate program and will be certified at the end of the semester in which they have completed their degree requirements. Policy on Master\u2019s Student Statute of Limitations www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of-limitations.html See the above link regarding guidelines and restrictions which place an upper limit on the maximum length of time allowable for master\u2019s degree completion and certification. Additional Guidance for Students Program of study. Students seeking guidance about their program of study and degree requirements should consult with their academic advisor and/or appropriate associate dean. Financial aid and student account Students are expected to make normal progress toward their degree to graduate within the standard timeframe for their program of study. Under U.S. Federal Title IV regulations, student eligibility for federal financial aid is contingent upon enrollment in and successful completion of courses that are counted as credit toward their current degree program. To receive the maximum amount of federal financial aid for which they may be eligible, students must enroll each semester in at least 36 units that count toward their current degree level. (See separate guidance regarding integrated degree completion.) Students should consult with their designated college liaison in The HUB regarding billing and financial aid, particularly for early completion, longer-than-standard completion, or integrated undergraduate and master\u2019s degree programs. International students Immigration status for students in F-1 and J-1 non-immigrant status is tied to making normal progress toward completing degree requirements. Therefore, F-1 and J-1 students who are considering completing their degree requirements early, anticipating longer-than-standard completion, or moving from an undergraduate to a graduate student classification (integrated undergraduate-graduate study) should consult with their designated advisor in the Office of International Education (OIE) to ensure compliance with immigration regulations|33tuition charge when returning the bill. You must pay previous semester balances before you can enroll for the next semester. 5.1.4 Carnegie Mellon employee reimbursement procedure Contact the Benefits Office for specific information on tuition benefits. You must complete a Tuition Remission Form each semester in order to receive these benefits. To receive a Tuition Remission Form, visit the Human Resources website at: http://www.cmu.edu/hr . 5.1.5 Financial aid, tuition waivers, Scholarships The MCDS degree program does not provide financial aid to graduate students, nor does it provide tuition waivers or scholarships. For complete financial aid information see: https://www.cmu.edu/sfs/financial-aid/index.html . The Financial Aid Office of Carnegie Mellon will provide assistance in completing the necessary paperwork to apply for Stafford loans. Graduate students should consult the graduate student financial aid information found on The HUB website: https://www.cmu.edu/sfs/financial-aid/graduate/index.html . Students will find the Graduate Financial Aid Guide, information about funding options and how to apply for financial aid and other helpful links. Graduate students who find themselves in need of immediate funds for emergency situations should contact the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs (see Appendix A), www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/index.html , to inquire about an Emergency Student Loan. U.S. citizens and permanent residents may complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) online at https://fafsa.ed.gov Students may obtain information regarding their loans through the William D. Ford Direct Loan Program, including deferment forms and payment information at http://www.dlssonline.com/index.asp Information about the federal student aid programs may be found at www.studentaid.ed.gov 5.1.6 External fellowships The MCDS program will accept students with external fellowships. 5.1.7 Grade Reports Grade reports are mailed to individual students by the university at the conclusion of each semester. See the official calendar for mailing dates. 5.1.8 Late Graduation|LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook Page 25 Note that self-funded Ph.D. students (e.g., those registered for five units while on semester interns hip) are not permitted to receive a partial stipend for the semester of their internship, while full-time LTI-sponsored students are eligible for a partial stipend. All students are caution ed to be aware of potential intellectual property (IP) problems with internships, and to review any IP agreements with their advisors before signing them. It is possible to lose ownership of your ideas. If the student is to receive academic credit for the internship, it must have deliverables from the student commensurate with the number of units, they are taking. This can be in the form of interim and final reports on the experience, presentations in the following semester regarding the experience, assessments of their experience as it relates to their course of study, etc. 4.1.3 Maximum Courseload Ph.D. students are permitted to register for a maximum of 54 units of coursework per semester. 4.1.4 Pass/Fail Grades Pass/fail grades are not permitted for courses used to satisfy a degree requirement. Graduate students who are required to take additional undergraduate courses to build up the core foundations of computer science may not elect the pass/fail option for th ese courses. 4.1.5 Transfer Credit An equivalent graduate course previously completed at another institution may be permitted to satisfy one of the Ph.D. course requirements. The decision on whether a course may be transferred is made by the Ph.D. Program Direct or. Typically, the student will provide the Program Director with the syllabus of the external course, and the Program Director will use that and the student\u2019s transcript to make the decision. See the section on \u201cDefinition of transfer credit versus cour se exemption .\u201d A student may not receive transfer credit for more than four courses. 4.1.6 Residency Requirements The university requires Ph.D. s to spend at least one year of residency at Carnegie Mellon. The SCS requires that all Ph.D. students must take at Carnegie Mellon a minimum of 48 units of the total coursework required by their respective programs|3 10.7 End of Semester Evaluation ........................................................................................................ 20 10.8 Enrollment Verification ............................................................................................................... 21 10.9 University Policies on Grades and Grading ................................................................................. 21 10.9.1 University Policy on Grades ................................................................................................ 21 10.9.2 University Policy on Grades for Transfer Courses & PCHE .................................................. 21 10.10 Academic Integrity .................................................................................................................. 21 11 Academic Policies ............................................................................................................................ 23 11.1 Course Registration ..................................................................................................................... 23 11.1.1 Status ............................................................................................................................... ... 23 11.1.2 Academic Calendar ............................................................................................................. 23 11.1.3 Online Registration ............................................................................................................. 23 11.1.4 Double\u2010Dipping ................................................................................................................... 24 11.1.5 Pass/No Pass Courses (Pass/Fail) ........................................................................................ 24 11.1.6 Auditing a Course ................................................................................................................ 24 11.1.7 Adding a Course .................................................................................................................. 24 11.1.8 Dropping a Course ............................................................................................................... 24 11.1.9 Transfer Credits ................................................................................................................... 25 11.1.10 Leave of Absence ............................................................................................................ 26 11.1.11 Additional Guidance for Students ................................................................................... 26 11.1.12 Withdrawal ...................................................................................................................... 27 11.2 Tuition and Fees .......................................................................................................................... 27 11.3 Graduation Ceremonies .............................................................................................................. 27 11.3.1 Withdrawal of Degree ......................................................................................................... 27 11.4 LTI Academic Policies .................................................................................................................. 27 11.4.1 \u201cGrandfather\u201d policy ........................................................................................................... 27 11.4.2 Definition of transfer credit versus course exemption ....................................................... 28 11.4.3 Employment/Consulting ..................................................................................................... 28 11.4.4 Leave of Absence ................................................................................................................ 28 11.4.5 Satisfactory Progress ........................................................................................................... 29 11.5 Carnegie Mellon Academic Policies ............................................................................................ 29 11.5.1 Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities ......................................................................... 29 11.5.2 Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures ................................... 29",

Standard MIIS degree (MIIS-16)-A 16-month track that is completed in three academic semesters (fall, spring, fall) and a summer internship. Option 2. MIIS: Advanced Study degree (MIIS-21)-A 21-month track that is completed in four academic semesters (fall, spring, fall, spring) and a summer internship. MIIS: Advanced Study track offers in depth degree in one of the following areas of concentration: \u2022 Human Language for Language Technologies \u2022 Language Technology Application \u2022 Machine Learning for Language Technologies Part-time options are available in some cases. 4.2 Required Units for Degree Attainment To complete the Master of Science in Intelligent Information Systems, a student must satisfy three types of requirements. Curricular requirements ensure that MIIS students receive instruction in core intelligent information systems technologies while also allowing an opportunity to specialize in areas of personal interest. Practice requirements are opportunities to apply and hone new skills while building state-of-the-art systems. Grade requirements ensure that students have demonstrated a certain level of sk ill while completing degree requirements. All three types of requirements are described below. MIIS-16 students must take at least 84 units (typically 7 12-unit courses) of qualifying and elective courses that satisfy human language, machine learning, and language technology applications breadth requirements and 66 practice units for a total of 150 units to attain the Standard MIIS degree. MIIS-21 students must take at least 108 units (typically 9 12-unit courses) of qualifying and elective courses and 66 practice units to satisfy their degree requirements, making it a total of 174 units to attain the MIIS: Advanced Study degree. 4.3 Core Requirements|Master of Science in Intelligent Information Systems (MIIS) Requirements:   The Intelligent Information Systems degree offers students the flexibility to create their own course of study in consultation with their advisor.   MIIS students gain three types of practical experience: software development supervised by their advisor (24 units equivalent to two courses); a summer internship (which can be waived for students that have sufficient prior professional experience); and a capstone project executed in a group of peers (42 units equivalent to three 12-unit courses and one 6-unit course). This combination is proven to help IIS students to broaden their skills quickly. The MIIS degree is offered in two options:  Option 1. Standard MIIS degree (MIIS-16) - A 16-month track that is completed in three academic semesters (fall, spring, fall) and a summer internship.    Option 2. MIIS: Advanced Study degree (MIIS-21) - A 21-month track that is completed in four academic semesters (fall, spring, fall, spring) and a summer internship.  MIIS: Advanced Study track offers indepth degree in one of the following areas of concentration:      Human Language for Language Technologies     Language Technology Application     Machine Learning for Language Technologies  Part-time education option is available in some cases.   MIIS-16 students must take at least 84 units (typically 7 courses) of qualifying and elective courses that satisfy human language, machine learning, and language technology applications breadth requirements. MIIS-21 students have to take at least two more courses from the selected concentration area to satisfy their degree requirements, making it total of 108 units (typically 9 courses) of qualifying and elective courses, that also satisfy breadth requirements.  For a full list of requirements, read the MIIS Handbook.|MIIS Graduate Student Handbook Page 25 Director. Typically , the student will provide the Program Director with the syllabus of the external course, and the Program Director will use that and the student\u2019s transcript to make the decision. Satisfying a breadth requirement with a course from another institution does not reduce the number of CMU course units that must be taken to attain the MIIS degree. See the section on \u201cDefinition of transfer credit versus course exemption\u201d on page 2 5. 6.1.6 Transferring into the MIIS Program Transfers into the MIIS program are not permitted during a student\u2019s first semester at CMU. Students must begin their study at CMU in the program that admitted them. Students may request to transfer into the MIIS program after completing their first semester and before the add/drop deadline of the spring semester. The student must make the request in writing (or email) to the MIIS Program Director. The MIIS Program D irector will inform the student about what application materials are required, for example, an explanation of why a transfer is desired, a proposed plan of study, a proposed advisor, and CMU transcripts. Students that are already enrolled in an LTI degree program are not required to retake GRE and TOEFL /IELTS/Duolingo exams or to produce new transcripts from other universities. The MIIS program will conduct an expedited admissions process after receiving such a request. The program will explicitly consider whether the coursework done prior to the transfer will allow the student to be \u201con schedule\u201d by the end of the spring semest er, so that the student can participate in a capstone project with other MIIS students during the next fall semester. MIIS students are allowed to switch tracks (MIIS-16 to MIIS-21 and vice versa) after beginning their first semester at CMU. Ideally, all switch requests must be filed within the first semester of the program. It is highly recommended to not switch tracks more than once! Though not forbidden, multiple track switching may negatively impact immigration records of international students. Students also must understand that extension of their stay in the program will lead to additional financial obligations. U.S. citizens, virtually, have no restrictions on how many times they can switch if it is done for a legitimate reason. To confirm legitimacy of the reason to switch tracks ALL students must seek their advisor's approval and the approval of the Director of the MIIS program. 6.1.7 Transferring Out of the MIIS Program The MIIS program does not prevent students from transferring to another degree program. Each degree program has its own rules about whether and when transfers into the program are permitted. A student that is interested in transferring out of the MIIS de gree program should consult the handbook and Program Director of the desired degree program to learn whether transfers are permitted, and if so, how, and when to request such a transfer|MIIS Graduate Student Handbook Page 18 Carnegie Mellon University offers students the opportunity to take courses for credit through a cross-registration program (see Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE) and Cross-registration below) and through the receipt of transfer credit from other accredited institutions. The Carnegie Mellon University transcript will include info rmation on such courses as follows: Carnegie Mellon courses and courses taken through the university's cross-registration program will have grades recorded on the transcript and be factored into the QPA. All other courses will be recorded on this transcript indicating where the course was taken, but without grades. Such courses will not be considered for academic actions, honors or QPA calculations. https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/transfer-credit-evaluation-and-assignment.html NOTE: Suspended students may take courses elsewhere; however, they may receive transfer credit only if their college\u2019s and department's policies allow this. 4.9 Internships If the experience will have units attached to it, the program should have deliverables from the student commensurate with the number of units they are taking. This can be in the form of interim and final reports on the experience, presentations in the foll owing semester regarding the experience, assessments of their experience as it relates to their course of study, etc. Students are responsible for identifying and applying for internships on their own. The LTI and the university provide several types of support for students seeking internships. An annual poster session helps spread information from MIIS students that recently completed internships to MIIS students that will soon seek internships; other LTI professional master\u2019s programs have similar internship-oriented poster sessions that MIIS s tudents may attend. The university offers resume-writing and interviewing workshops to help prepare students and fall and spring employment fairs to help students connect with companies. The university\u2019s Career & Professional Development Center https://www.cmu.edu/career/ provides other services as well. If a student cannot find an internship, the MIIS program will arrange an on-campus internship with a university-based project. This internship may be unpaid. International students are required to consult with Office of International Education for eligibility before seeking an internship/co-op or signing an offer contract (required addition to ensure the university is in compliance with immigration laws for F & J status students) . 4.10 Advising",

We have adopted the following hearing procedure and \u201ctwo strikes\u201d rule: \uf0b7 If an instructor determines that an academic integrity violation has occurred, both the instructor and students are given the opportunity to explain the situation to the MCDS program committee. A written hearing by email suffices for this purpose. \uf0b7 The program committee then reviews all information and decides whether the violation is deemed an infraction (see 3.3.17), and which secondary actions are to be taken on the program level. \uf0b7 Two-Strike-Rule: MCDS may dismiss students upon a first AIV infraction. A second infraction will always lead to the offending student being dismissed from the program, with no exceptions. The MCDS program reserves the right to withdraw a degree even though it has been granted should there be discovery that the work upon which it was based or the academic records in support of it had been falsified. In such a case, the degree will be withdrawn promptly upon discovery of the falsification.

Carnegie Mellon University educates its students to become professionals who will serve society with integrity. The university also creates and disseminates new knowledge and expressions of knowledge in ways that benefit society. Carnegie Mellon strives to serve the changing needs of society through the three primary goals outlined in its mission statement: to create and disseminate knowledge and art through research and artistic expression, teaching and learning and transfer to society, to serve students by teaching them leadership and problem-solving skills, and the values of quality, ethical behavior, responsibility to society and commitments to work, to pursue the advantages provided by a diverse community, open to the exchange of ideas, where discovery and artistic creativity can flourish. In any presentation, creative, artistic or research, it is the ethical responsibility of each student to identify the conceptual sources of the work submitted. Failure to do so is dishonest and is the basis for a charge of cheating or plagiarism, which is subject to disciplinary action.

It is an absolute requirement that the work you submit must be your own, unless you specifically identify the source of any material th at is not yours. This includes quotations and material from websites. In any written work (including presentations) you MUST list any person other than yourself who assisted you in preparing that wo rk. Any student who violates the academic integrity policy will be subject to a University review that may result in suspension or expulsion under University policies. THE PROGRAM DIRECTOR, THE FACULTY AND THE UNIVERSITY ARE VERY SERIOUS ABOUT ENFORCEMENT OF THE ACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY. You are not permitted to copy material from web pages, including Wikipedia, and present them as your own work. Any copied material MUST appe ar in quotation marks or italics and MUST be accompanied by a citation to the original source. Failure to do this violates CMU\u2019s Policy on Academic Integrity, which states, \u201cIn all academic work to be graded, the citation of all sources is required. \u2026 Plagiarism is defined as the use of work or concepts contributed by other individuals without proper attribution or citation . Unique ideas or materia ls taken from another source for either written or oral use must be fully acknowledged in academic work to be graded.\u201d It is a violation of academic integrity for you to assist anyone else in violating the policy or to provide your work to others to assist them.

A.3.2 Health Services https://www.cmu.edu/HealthServices/|MIIS Graduate Student Handbook Page 23 A review of the University\u2019s Academic Disciplinary Actions procedures https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/academic-discipline/index.html is also recommended. These procedures outline the process for investigating, reporting, and adjudicating violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity. The procedures also outline the appeal process. In the midst of self-exploration, the high demands of a challenging academic environment can create situations where some students have difficulty exercising good judgment. Academic challenges can provide many opportunities for high standards to evolve if students actively reflect on these challenges and if the community supports discussions to aid in this process. It is the responsibility of the entire community to establish and maintain the integrity of our university. Carnegie Mellon University educates its students to become professionals who will serve society with integrity. The university also creates and disseminates new knowledge and expressions of knowledge in ways that benefit society. Carnegie Mellon strives to serve the changing needs of society through the three primary goals outlined in its mission statement: to create and disseminate knowledge and art through research and artistic expression, teaching and learning and transfer to society, to serve students by teaching them leadership and problem-solving skills, and the values of quality, ethical behavior, responsibility to society and commitments to work, to pursue the advantages provided by a diverse community, open to the exchange of ideas, where discovery and artistic creativity can flourish. In any presentation, creative, artistic or research, it is the ethical responsibility of each student to identify the conceptual sources of the work submitted. Failure to do so is dishonest and is the basis for a charge of cheating or plagiarism, which is subject to disciplinary action. The university has a very clear and specific protocol for responding to alleged violations of academic integrity. Carnegie Mellon's Academic Disciplinary Actions Overview for Graduate Students describes procedures for disciplinary actions against graduate students in cases of alleged violations of academic regulations and the appeal process. Important note: The LTI implements the above policy\u2019s option of \u201cconven[ing] a disciplinary hearing according to the procedures of the department/program\u201d. Our procedure is as follows: a first violation is grounds for dismissal from the graduate program. If we decide to not immediately dismiss, the first violation will result in the student being on disciplinary probation. If a student commits a second violation while on probation, the penalty is dismissal from the graduate program. 6 Academic Policies 6.1 MIIS Academic Policies",
