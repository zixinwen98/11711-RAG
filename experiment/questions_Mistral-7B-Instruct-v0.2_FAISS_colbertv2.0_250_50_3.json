For more information, please refer to the School of Computer Science Fee Waiver page.\n\nRequirements\n\nThe School of Computer Science requires the following for all Master's applications.\n\n    GRE scores: MIIS applicants must submit their GRE scores. The scores must be less than five years old. The GRE Subject Test is not required, but is recommended. Our Institution Code is 2074; Department Code is 0402.\n\n    Proof of English Language Proficiency:\n\nIf you will be studying on an F-1 or J-1 visa, and English is not a native language for you (native language\u2026meaning spoken at home and from birth), we are required to formally evaluate your English proficiency. We require applicants who will be studying on an F-1 or J-1 visa, and for whom English is not a native language, to demonstrate English proficiency via one of these standardized tests: TOEFL (preferred), IELTS, or Duolingo.  We discourage the use of the \"TOEFL ITP Plus for China,\" since speaking is not scored.\n\nWe do not issue waivers for non-native speakers of English.  In particular, we do not issue waivers based on previous study at a U.S. high school, college, or university.  We also do not issue waivers based on previous study at an English-language high school, college, or university outside of the United States.  No amount of educational experience in English, regardless of which country it occurred in, will result in a test waiver. Submit valid, recent scores: If as described above you are required to submit proof of English proficiency, your TOEFL, IELTS or Duolingo test scores will be considered valid as follows: If you have not received a bachelor\u2019s degree in the U.S., you will need to submit an English proficiency score no older than two years. (scores from exams taken before Sept. 1, 2021, will not be accepted.)\n\nIf you are currently working on or have received a bachelor's and/or a master's degree in the U.S., you may submit an expired test score up to five years old. (scores from exams taken before Sept. 1, 2018, will not be accepted.)Additional details about English proficiency requirements are provided on the FAQ page.\n\n    Official transcripts from each university you have attended, regardless of whether you received your degree there.\n    Current resume.\n    Statement of Purpose.\n    Three letters of recommendation.\n\nFor more details on these requirements, please see the SCS Master's Admissions page.\n\nIn addition to the SCS guidelines, the MIIS requires:\n\n    A short (1-3 minute) video of yourself. There will be a prompt question that you will respond to. You will have three attempts.\n\nNo incomplete applications will be eligible for consideration.\n\nFor specific application/admissions questions, please contact Brianna Eriksen.\n\n",

Since \nconsulting provides useful experience, students are generally permitted to consult at most one \nday per seven- day week, with the advisor's consent .

Chiu, Daniel Fried Abstract: When a model is trying to gather information in an interactive setting, it benefits from asking informative questions. However, in the case of a grounded multi-turn image identification task, previous studies have been constrained to polar yes/no questions, limiting how much information the model can gain in a single turn. We present an approach that formulates more informative, open-ended questions. In doing so, we discover that off-the-shelf visual question answering (VQA) models often make presupposition errors, which standard information gain question selection methods fail to account for. To address this issue, we propose a method that can incorporate presupposition handling into both question selection and belief updates. Specifically, we use a two-stage process, where the model first filters out images which are irrelevant to a given question, then updates its beliefs about which image the user intends. Through self-play and human evaluations, we show that our method is successful in asking informative open-ended questions, increasing accuracy over the past state-of-the-art by 14%, while resulting in 48% more efficient games in human evaluations.|24.

You should discuss your proposed project with the faculty member and submit a proposal outlining the scope, goals, and expected outcomes of the project. Once the faculty member agrees to supervise your project, you can then register for the independent study course through the university registration system.
