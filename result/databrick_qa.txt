History
Tom Lamb was the son of Thomas Henry Peacock (THP) Lamb, who had emigrated from England in the late 19th century. THP Lamb turned from school teacher to fur trader and in 1900, started Lamb's Store in Moose Lake, Manitoba. Tom and his brothers and sisters grew up in northern Manitoba and worked for their father.

Tom Lamb left school before finishing grade 3. Later in life, he would make the comment, while giving his acceptance speech when receiving his honorary Doctorate of law from the University of Manitoba, "If I had only gotten to grade 4". At the age of 10, Tom, who had his own team of horses and sleigh, was competing with grown men in the fish hauling business. He would have to use fish boxes to step up on to be able to load his sleigh.

One of the Lamb family's businesses was "logistics and transportation". Fish, lumber, trees, fur and supplies needed to be hauled by any and all means. Dog teams, horses, boats, trucks and tractors were used. In the 1930s there was a transportation revolution happening. The aircraft was making its way into northern Canada. The first time Tom Lamb saw an aircraft he realized its potential. In 1930, Tom bought his first aircraft - a Stinson SR8. In 1930, Tom Lamb travelled to Winnipeg to learn to fly. To keep costs to a minimum, he lived in a tent behind the Winnipeg Flying Club. When he returned to The Pas and checked himself out on the Stinson.

In 1935, Tom incorporated Lamb Airways Limited. The airline had some name changes throughout the years and Tom became one of the best known Manitobans, if not Canadians, in the world. His adventures have been documented in books, a television documentary and even a song.

question is: List 10 highest-grossing actors in the world.
model answer is: : 1. Tom Cruise - $1.2 billion
actual answer (first reference) is: The following are non-definitive lists of the actors with the highest career-film grosses. There are box-office gross revenue lists, which are not adjusted for inflation, as well as lists for the number of box-office ticket sales. Because of the long-term effects of inflation on movie theater ticket prices, a list unadjusted for inflation gives far more weight to later actors. Therefore, the gross revenue lists are largely meaningless for comparing acting careers widely separated in time, as many actors from earlier eras will never appear on a modern unadjusted list, despite their films' achieving higher commercial success when adjusted for price increases.

Lead roles
This list only includes leading roles and lead ensemble roles, including voice acting. The list is updated as of 12 January 2023.

question is: What are the defense mechanisms?
model answer is: : The defense mechanism is an unconscious psychological process that helps people cope with anxiety by blocking out unpleasant thoughts, feelings, or memories. There are several different types of defense mechanisms, including repression, denial, projection, displacement, rationalization, and sublimation. Repression involves pushing unwanted thoughts or memories into the unconscious mind, while denial involves refusing to accept reality. Projection occurs when someone attributes their own unacceptable thoughts or feelings onto another person. Displacement involves redirecting one's emotions from an actual source to a substitute target. Rationalization involves creating logical explanations for behavior that would otherwise be considered irrational. Sublimation involves channeling negative impulses into socially acceptable activities.
actual answer (first reference) is: There are multiple definitions of defense mechanism based on different theories. Generally, defense mechanisms are human responses responses to anxiety and how the consciousness and unconscious manage the stress of a social situation. Some of the most common defense mechanisms include:

Repression: forcing a feeling from the consciousness to the unconscious because it is seen as socially unacceptable

Regression: falling back into an early state of mental/physical development seen as less demanding and safer

Projection: possessing a feeling that is deemed as socially unacceptable and instead of facing it, that feeling or "unconscious urge" is seen in the actions of other people

Reaction formation: acting the opposite way that the unconscious instructs a person to behave, "often exaggerated and obsessive". For example, if a wife is infatuated with a man who is not her husband, reaction formation may cause her to – rather than cheat – become obsessed with showing her husband signs of love and affection.

Sublimation: seen as the most acceptable of the mechanisms, an expression of anxiety in socially acceptable ways

question is: Which player scored the Premier League winning goal for Manchester City vs. QPR in 2012?
model answer is: : The player who scored the Premier League winning goal for Manchester City vs. QPR in 2012 was Sergio Agüero. He scored the equalizer in the 88th minute with a powerful header from a corner kick.
actual answer (first reference) is: Sergio Aguero, in his first season for the club following a £30+ million move from Athletico Madrid ended the season as the club's leading goal scorer. Ten plus years later, he ended as the club's all-time leading goal scorer and holds the record for number of Premier League Hat-tricks. 

In 2012, Manchester City and local rivals, Manchester United were leading a two horse race to win the Premier League. Manchester United had previously won the league title 19 times where as this would be Manchester City's first title in over 40 years. 

It was Manchester City's to lose as they hosted relegation-bounded QPR at the Etihad Stadium and all was going to plan going into the first half following Zabaleta's goal to make it 1-0 (an unlikely goal scorer to say the least). 

However, following a mistake from centre back, Joleon Lescott, a dramatic red card for former Manchester City player, Joey Barton and a surprise second goal from QPR to make it 2-1, Manchester City looked as though they'd let the title slip through their hands. 

Manchester United had won their away game at Sunderland 1-0 so it was all down the blue half of Manchester's result. 

Just after the 90th minute, they were in stoppage time which was extended due to the commotions with Joey Barton lashing out at Carlos Tevez and Sergio Aguero. 

Striker, Edin Dzeko, scored a header from a David Silva cross to make it 2-2, but to many, this felt as too little, too late. 

Late drama unfolded as Mario Balotelli registered his one and only assist in almost 4 years at the club as he laid it off to Aguero who scored the winning goal with the last kick of the game to make it 3-2. 

Manchester City went on to win the league and QPR avoided relegation despite the loss due to results elsewhere.

question is: Tell me about Roger Federer
model answer is: : Roger Federer is a professional tennis player from Switzerland who has won 20 Grand Slam singles titles, including four Wimbledon Championships and three US Open Championships. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest tennis players of all time and has been ranked world No. 1 in men's singles on multiple occasions. Federer is known for his powerful serve, precise shot placement, and elegant playing style. He has also been praised for his sportsmanship and charitable work.
actual answer (first reference) is: Roger Federer, born 8 August 1981, is a Swiss former professional tennis player. He was ranked world No. 1 by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) for 310 weeks, including a record 237 consecutive weeks, and finished as the year-end No. 1 five times. He won 103 singles titles on the ATP Tour, the second most of all time, including 20 major men's singles titles, a record eight men's singles Wimbledon titles, an Open Era joint-record five men's singles US Open titles, and a joint-record six year-end championships. In his home country, he is regarded as "the greatest and most successful" Swiss sportsperson in history.

A Wimbledon junior champion in 1998 and former ball boy, Federer won his first major singles title at Wimbledon in 2003 at age 21. Between 2003 and 2009, Federer played in 21 out of 28 major singles finals. He won three of the four majors and the ATP Finals in 2004, 2006, and 2007 as well as five consecutive titles at both Wimbledon and the US Open. He completed the career Grand Slam at the 2009 French Open after three consecutive runner-up finishes to Nadal, his main rival until 2010. At age 27, he surpassed Pete Sampras' record of 14 major men's singles titles at Wimbledon in 2009.

Federer and Stan Wawrinka led the Switzerland Davis Cup team to their first title in 2014, following their Olympic doubles gold victory at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Federer also won a silver medal in singles at the 2012 London Olympics, finishing runner-up to Andy Murray. After a half-year hiatus in late 2016 to recover from knee surgery, Federer returned to tennis, winning three more majors over the next two years, including the 2017 Australian Open over Rafael Nadal and an eighth singles title at the 2017 Wimbledon Championships. At the 2018 Australian Open, Federer became the first man to win 20 major singles titles and shortly the oldest ATP world No. 1 at age 36. In September 2022, he retired from professional tennis following the Laver Cup.

A versatile all-court player, Federer's perceived effortlessness has made him highly popular among tennis fans. Originally lacking self-control as a junior, he transformed his on-court demeanor to become well-liked for his graciousness, winning the Stefan Edberg Sportsmanship Award 13 times. He has won the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year award a record five times. Outside of competing, he played an instrumental role in the creation of the Laver Cup team competition. He is also an active philanthropist. He established the Roger Federer Foundation, which targets impoverished children in southern Africa, and has raised funds in part through the Match for Africa exhibition series. He is routinely one of the top ten highest-paid athletes in any sport and ranked first among all athletes with $100 million in endorsement income in 2020.

question is: Why is JDAM so cost effective?
model answer is: : The JDAM's guidance system is jointly developed by the United States Air Force and United States Navy, hence the "joint" in JDAM. When installed on a bomb, the JDAM kit is given a GBU (Guided Bomb Unit) identifier, superseding the Mark 80 or BLU (Bomb, Live Unit) nomenclature of the bomb to which it is attached.
actual answer (first reference) is: The Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) is a guidance kit that converts unguided bombs to precision-guided munitions. There are several reasons why JDAM is one of the most cost effective weapons ever invented.

By using GPS navigation, the JDAM guidance kit can be extremely cheap, as low as $25k/kit.  It is likely cheaper than any other precision-guided weapons.

GPS navigation provides good targeting precision, typically within meters. Combined with blast radius of 500-2000 lbs unguided bombs, JDAM can effectively destroy any targets on the ground.

Because JDAM has navigation capability, pilots no longer need to precisely aim the bombers  against the targets. It allows a bomber to quickly and precisely hit multiple targets along the route.

Some JDAM guidance kits include targeting sensors, such as laser targeting. They can be used against mobile targets, which further increases the use cases for JDAM.

In summary, by combining dumb bombs with a guidance kit, JDAM becomes a very cost effective weapon system, and is widely adopted by the US and other military forces.

The Open Source Initiative promotes the use of open source software, which means that the source code is freely available, but also subject to certain licenses that allow users to modify and redistribute the code under certain conditions. Both movements aim to promote the principles of freedom, transparency, and collaboration in software development, but they differ in their definitions and implementations of these principles.
actual answer (first reference) is: The Free Software Movement is the better organization for me since I also hold a high value on ethics and believe in that vision.

question is: Given this paragraph describing the conclusion of the movie Groundhog Day, how did Phil manage to break the cycle and wake up on February 3 instead of back once again on February 2?
model answer is: : Phil managed to break the cycle by realizing that he had been living a life of monotony and repetition, and that he needed to take control of his own destiny. He made the decision to change his actions and choices, which ultimately led to him waking up on February 3 instead of being trapped in the same day over and over again. Additionally, he found inspiration from the character of Bill Murray's character, who also broke free from the cycle by making a conscious effort to live each day differently. This shows that breaking out of a repetitive pattern requires self-awareness, determination, and a willingness to try new things.
actual answer (first reference) is: This paragraph summarizing the conclusion of Groundhog Day explains what was happening when Phil wakes up on February 3 but does not explain why he is able to escape the loop.

During this time she transformed the economic situation in the United Kingdom by introducing economic policies intended to reverse high inflation and weak growth. By constraining the power of trades unions and overseeing extensive deregulation and privatisation, Thatcher helped to create a period of extended growth and economic success. Together with Ronald Reagan, she was also instrumental in recognising and supporting the opportunity to end communist rule in the Soviet Union, where she was dubbed the 'Iron Lady', through her friendship with the Russian leader, Mikhail Gorbachev. Her legacy was to end the so-called 'post-war consensus' in the UK (characterised by high taxes, regulation and nationalisation) and to replace it with policies that encouraged free-enterprise and personal responsibility while acknowledging the importance of the welfare state, provided it was administered responsibly. Although disliked by many on the left for the way that she challenged excessive union power, she is generally acknowledged as the most important British politician of the late twentieth century.

question is: Based on the information provided, what was the controversy surrounding the 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix?
model answer is: : The controversy surrounding the 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix was related to the safety car procedure during the race. During the last laps of the race, Michael Masi, who was responsible for controlling the safety car, allowed only the five cars directly in between championship contenders Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen to unlap themselves before the restart. This decision resulted in Verstappen overtaking Hamilton and winning the 2021 World Drivers' Championship. 
actual answer (first reference) is: While there was a lot of complexity based on the circumstances that occurred, the prevailing controversy with the race was related to the fact that lapped cars were only partially allowed to clear the track. This meant that Max Verstappen was cleared to attack Lewis Hamilton on fresher tyres for the last part of the final lap. Lewis and Max both needed to win the final race to win the championship. This would have been Max's first ever championship or Lewis' record-breaking 8th championship. By allowing only the cars between Max and Lewis, the race director only partially adhered to the rules. This virtually handed the win to Max and Red Bull. While Mercedes immediately protested the decision and final result. Max was awarded the championship.

actual answer (first reference) is: No, patatas bravas could not have existed in 1490. This is because in 1490 the Americas had not yet been visited by Europeans, and so Spaniards didn't have access to the potatoes, tomatoes or chilis present in the dish, because those plants are all from the Americas originally.

question is: How is a circular economy different than the USA's economy?
model answer is: : A circular economy differs from the current linear economy in that it aims to eliminate waste and pollution by keeping products and materials in use for as long as possible. In contrast, the current linear economy is based on the "take-make-dispose" model, where resources are extracted, used, and then discarded. This leads to significant environmental degradation and resource depletion. By adopting a circular economy approach, we can reduce our reliance on finite resources, minimize waste generation, and promote sustainable practices.
actual answer (first reference) is: A circular economy focuses on the principles of eliminating waste and pollution, circulating products and materials, and the regeneration of nature. In contrast, most capitalistic economies are called "linear" in that raw materials are turned into products which are eventually discarded. While a circular economy focuses on sustainable consumption on an Earth with limited resources, linear economies like the USA's implicitly assume a never-ending supply of raw material inputs.
