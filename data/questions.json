    "context": "\nFirst freshman-level computer science course\n\nIn 1956 and 1957, Simon, Allen Newell (IA'57) and Cliff Shaw of RAND designed the Logic Theorist, a computer program that could develop proofs for theorems in much the same way a human would work. They also developed linked-list data structures, the foundation of computer programming. Perlis, Simon and Newell are credited with defining the term \u201ccomputer science\u201d as \u201cthe theory and design of computers,\u201d as well as (in Newell\u2019s words) \u201cthe study of the phenomena arising from them.\u201d In 1958, Perlis began teaching the first freshman-level computer programming course in the United States at Carnegie Tech.\n"

    "question": "How many faculty members did the School of Computer Science have in 2013?",
    "answer": "284",
    "context": "\nCommitted to extending our founders\u2019 vision\n\nThe School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University enters its second quarter century as a world-leading educational and research institution, embracing all facets of computing. Its graduate programs are consisted ranked with the best in the world by a leading U.S. magazine, while its undergraduate programs are also rated the best in the U.S. by corporate recruiters. In 2013, SCS had 284 faculty members and a total student enrollment of nearly 1,700, including undergraduate, master\u2019s and Ph.D. students, and conducted $124 million in research. Indeed, by itself, the Robotics Institute is the largest university robotics research group in the world, with more than 500 people and more than 100 ongoing research projects. A half-century ago, Perlis, Simon and Newell outlined a vision for computer science. The School of Computer Science at CMU remains committed to continuing and extending their vision in the context of big data and connected computing in the 21st century.\n"

    "question": "Who received the A.M. Turing Award in 1975 for their work in artificial intelligence?",
    "answer": "Herbert Simon and Allen Newell",
    "context": "\nTuring Awards and a Nobel Prize\n\nIn 1975, Simon and Newell were awarded the A.M. Turing Award for their work in artificial intelligence. (As of 2014, 12 CMU alumni or faculty have been awarded Turings, sometimes considered the Nobel Prize of computing.) Three years later, Simon received the Nobel Prize in Economics for his work on decision-making theory. As the 1970s progressed, Newell became interested in human-computer interaction, and began a long relationship with Xerox\u2019s Palo Alto Research Center, or PARC, which released the Xerox Alto in 1973. Considered a forerunner to many of the computing environments that followed, Alto featured a graphical-user interface and was among the first commercially available workstations controlled with a mouse. Inspired by Alto, Reddy launched a drive for development of CMU\u2019s own \u201cthree-M\u201d machine\u2014a personal workstation with a megabyte of memory, a megapixel display and at least one million instructions per second of processing power.\n"
