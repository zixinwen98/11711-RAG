Welcome to the Language Technologies Institute, a graduate department in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. You have joined a Ph.D. program that focuses on excellence, creativity, and training the next generation of research leaders. While the next few years will be a time of hard work and intense concentration, we hope that your time at the LTI will also be rewarding professionally and personally. Obtaining a Ph.D. is a long and often intense journey. A healthy work-life balance helps to keep it in perspective. Carnegie Mellon is located in Pittsburgh, a city with a rich industrial and labor heritage. In the past, it was the heart of the U.S. steel industry, a source for quality packaged foods, an important financial hub, and an early pioneer in railroads, radio, and nuclear power. This is a city where people worked hard and made things that changed the world. Today, Pittsburgh has reinvented itself as a leader in Computer Science and medicine, but it is still a place where people work hard and make things that change the world . It is also an informal city, where people don\u2019t take themselves too seriously and remember to have fun. It is home to excellent museums, competitive professional sports teams, inexpensive magic shows, and free music during the summer, with skiing and magnificent state parks nearby. Your stay here will be more rewarding if you make time for e xploring the many activities that Pittsburgh and Southwest Pennsylvania have to offer. There are significant differences between CMU's different departments and degree programs in philosophical approach, procedures, policies, and regulations. Each department issues a handbook that informs graduate students of their program requirements and procedures and ensures that students have written access to standard information. This handbook describes the policies, procedures, and requirements for the Ph.D. in Language and Information Technologies. All policies not explicitly described in this document conform to School of Computer Science (SCS) policies and university policies. For information about Carnegie Mellon requirements and policies, please see the university\u2019s handbook The Word , the Office of Graduate and Postdoctoral Affairs web page , the Office of the Dean of Students web page , and other resources contained in Appendix A of this handbook. Welcome! We hope that your time here is a life-changing experience. 1.1 Degrees Offered The Language Technologies Institute offers two Ph.D. programs and four Master degrees. \u2022 Ph.D. in Language and Information Technologies (LTI Ph.D. ) \u2022 Dual-Degree Ph.D. in Language and Information Technologies (CMU-PT Ph.D.) \u2022 Masters in Language Technologies (MLT) \u2022 Master of Science in Intelligent Information Systems (MIIS) \u2022 Master of Computational Data Science (MCDS) \u2022 Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence and Innovation (MSAII)", "LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook Page 10 This handbook applies to the LTI Ph.D. The Ph.D. in Language and Information Technologies (LTI Ph.D. ) is focused on understanding and extending the state of the art in computational linguistics, natural language processing, dialogue systems, information retrieval, machine translation, speech processing, video understanding, multimodal systems, automated reasoning, and other topics related to analysis and understanding of unstructured information (e.g., machine learning, and software engineering of intelligent systems). 1.2 Department Personnel The people responsible for administering the LTI Ph.D. degree are: Jamie Callan Ph.D. Program Director Professor GHC 5419 callan@cs.cmu.edu 412-268-4525 Stacey Young Ph.D. Academic Program Manager LTI Graduate Program Manager GHC 6415 staceyy@cs.cmu.edu 412-268-2623 Mona Diab LTI Director Professor GHC 5723 mdiab@andrew.cmu.edu 412-268-3669 Joan Axelson Office Manager GHC 5405 jaxelson@andrew.cmu.edu 412-268-7517 Julie Nys Employment Processes Manger GHC 5405 jnys@andrew.cmu.edu 412-268-3515 1.3 University Policies and Expectations It is the responsibility of each member of the Carnegie Mellon community to be familiar with university policies and guidelines. In addition to this departmental graduate student handbook, the following resources are available to assist you in understanding community expectations. \u2022 The Word/Student Handbook: https://www.cmu.edu/student-a ffairs/theword//index.html \u2022 Academic Integrity Policy: https:// www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html", "LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook Page 11 \u2022 University Policies Website: https://www.cmu.edu/policies/ \u2022 Office of Graduate and Postdoctoral Affairs: https://www.cmu.edu/graduate/policies/index.html Due to the changing nature of conditions and expectations surrounding public health and safety requirements please visit https:// www.cmu.edu/coronavirus/ for the most up to date information. Please see Appendix A for additional information about The Word and University resources. 1.4 The Academic Calendar The Academic calendar can be found at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/calendar/index.html and provides information on all deadlines, including registration dates, class start dates, add/drop deadlines, exam dates, and more. Some doctoral course-sections follow a separate Academic Calendar . 1.5 Carnegie Mellon University Statement of Assurance Carnegie Mellon University does not discriminate in admission, employment, or administration of its programs or activities on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, handicap or disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic information. Furthermore, Carnegie Mellon University does not discriminate and is required not to discriminate in violation of federal, state, or local laws or executive orders. Inquiries concerning the application of a compliance with this statement should be directed to the university ombuds person , Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 (412-268-1018). Obtain general information about Carnegie Mellon University by calling 412-268-2000. Carnegie Mellon University publishes an annual campus security and fire safety report describing the university\u2019s security, alcohol and drug, sexual assault, and fire safety policies, and containing statistics about the number and type of crimes committed on campus, and the number and cause of fires in campus residence facilities during the preceding three years. You can obtain a copy by contacting the Carnegie Mellon Police Department at 412-268-2323. The annual security and fire safety report also is available online at www.cmu.edu/police/annualreports . Information regarding the applicable grievance procedures for alleged violations of the Statement of Assurance is available at https://www.cmu.edu/policies/forms-and-documents/soa-violations.pdf . The Office for Institutional Equity and Title IX may be reached at 412-268-7125", "LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook Page 12 or institutionalequity@cmu.edu . 1.6 The Carnegie Mellon Code Students at Carnegie Mellon, because they are members of an academic community dedicated to the achievement of excellence, are expected to meet the highest standards of personal, ethical, and moral conduct possible. These standards require personal integrity, a commitment to honesty without compromise, as well as truth without equivocation and a willingness to place the good of the community above the good of the self. Obligations once undertaken must be met, commitments kept. As members of the Carnegie Mellon community, individuals are expected to uphold the standards of the community in addition to holding others accountable for said standards. It is rare that the life of a student in an academic community can be so private that it will not affect the community as a whole or that the above standards do not apply. The discovery, advancement and communication of knowledge are not possible without a commitment to these standards. Creativity cannot exist without acknowledgment of the creativity of others. New knowledge cannot be developed without credit for prior knowledge. Without the ability to trust that these principles will be observed, an academic community cannot exist. The commitment of its faculty, staff and students to these standards con tributes to the high respect in which the Carnegie Mellon degree is held. Students must not destroy that respect by their failure to meet these standards. Students who cannot meet them should voluntarily withdraw from the university. The Carnegie Mellon C ode can also be found here: https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/ . 2 The Language Technologies Institute 2.1 Pittsburgh Campus Location The Language Technologies Institute is located primarily on the 5th and 6th floors of the Gates Hillman Complex (GHC) on Carnegie Mellon\u2019s Pittsburgh campus. The address and contact information of the LTI are shown below. Language Technologies Institute Carnegie Mellon University 5000 Forbes Avenue Gates Hillman Complex Pittsburgh, PA 15241-3891", "LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook Page 13 412-268-6298 (fax) http://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/ Office locations for faculty, staff, and Ph.D. students can be found on the LTI website. 2.2 Office Space Most Ph.D. students in residence on the Pittsburgh campus are given an office in which to study and do research. Typically, offices are shared with other Ph.D. students, but they may also be shared with staff, visitors, or other members of the LTI. Offices are assigned by the LTI\u2019s Office Manager (see Section 1.2 , Department Personnel, for contact information). 2.3 Mailboxes and Office Supplies Mailboxes and office supplies are in GHC 5404. 2.4 Photocopies and Printers Printers and photocopies are available to LTI students. The use of a photocopier or printer requires you to log in with your CMU ID card. LTI students may use printers/photocopiers scattered throughout the School of Computer Science buildings , but the machines in GHC 5404 and GHC 6604 are the most convenient . The SCS Computing Facilities publishes a list of printers online at https://computing.cs.cmu.edu/desktop/printer-list. 2.5 Computers for LTI Ph.D. Students Ph.D. students are responsible for having their own laptop computers to support their education and research. Students are free to choose their own operating system (e.g., Linux, MacOs, Windows). Many Ph.D. advisors also provide access to computer clusters, cloud computing, or other resources to support computationally-intense research. Ph.D. students are given access to the LTI\u2019s computer cluster on an as-needed basis, to be used for course assignments, directed study projects, and/or capstone projects. The LTI cluster provides storage and computation for projects involving large datasets and/or lengthy computation. Ph.D. students receive two types of user ids: An Andrew id and a CS id. All CMU students have an Andrew id. Computer Science students also have a CS id that provides access to SCS-specific resources (e.g., computer clusters). CS ids are being phased out very slowly, so it is likely that you will need both types of user id", "LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook Page 14 The School of Computer Science has a Help Center in GHC 4201 . It can be contacted at help@cs.cmu.edu , extension 8-4231 from a campus phone, or 412-268-4231 from an outside line (M-F, 9am-5pm) . 3 Standard Degree Requirements & Degree Certification 3.1 LTI Ph.D. Degree Requirements To complete the Ph.D. in Language and Information Technologies degree, the student must satisfy the following requirements: \u2022 Pass at least 96 units of graduate level courses, with additional requirements detailed below ; \u2022 Satisfy proficiencies in Writing, Presentation, Programming, and Teaching ; \u2022 Propose , write, and defend a Ph.D. dissertation (thesis) ; \u2022 Attend the LTI Colloquium (11-700) each semester ; and \u2022 Satisfy the Research Speaking Requirement. The sections below provide more detail about each of these requirements. 3.1.1 Course Requirements To complete the course requirements for the Ph.D. in Language and Information Technologies degree, the student must pass 96 or more course units of graduate courses, and meet the following criteria: \u2022 At least 72 units of \u201cLTI\u201d courses and 24 units of \u201cSCS\u201d courses, \u2022 At least one class in each \u201cLTI Focus Area\u201d, and \u2022 At least two labs, in two different research areas . For definitions of quoted terms, see the section on \u201cDefinitions of LTI Terminology\u201d. Unless approved by the Program Director in advance, the course requirements must be satisfied by actual classroom courses, not credit given for research or independent study. An \u201cLTI course \u201d is any 12-unit course with a number of 11-XXX; a 6-unit course with 11-XXX counts as one-half of an LTI course. Unless otherwise specified, \"course\" means an actual classroom course, not credit given for research or independent study. Note that the LTI allow s any one MLD (10-XXX) graduate course to count as an \"LTI course\". An \u201cSCS course\u201d is any 12-unit course with a course number indicating a unit of the School of Computer Science (including LTI); a 6-unit course with such a number counts as one-half of an SCS course. Unless otherwise specified, \"course\" means an actual classroom course, not credit given for research or independent study. Note: Recommended electives that are technically", "LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook Page 15 outside of the SCS now count towards this requirement; for example, Digital Signal Processing in ECE. Please see the Program Director for approval of electives as \u201cSCS.\u201d \u201cLTI Focus Areas\u201d are sets of courses defined on the LTI course webpage under \u201cCourse Categories.\u201d If a student believes a new course should be added to a Focus Area, they should make a request to the Ph.D. Program Director . They will decide, with advice from faculty in the appropriate area, whether it should be in the Focus Area. I f approved , it will be added to the LTI Focus Area webpage. A \u201cTask-Orientation Focus Course \u201d is a course belonging to that LTI Focus Area, as listed on the LTI\u2019s \u201cCourse Categories\u201d webpage. An LTI \u201c lab course \u201d is a course in the list of lab courses defined o n the LTI \u2019s \u201cCourse Categories\u201d webpage . 3.1.2 Grade Requirements Students must demonstrate their mastery of material taught in courses and their success in applying their skills in directed stu dy by satisfying the following grade requirements . Minimum grade: Only courses with a grade of B (3.0) or higher are counted as satisfying a degree requirement. Pass/fail: Pass/fail grades are not permitted for courses and projects used to satisfy a degree requirement. 3.1.3 Proficiency Requirements The LTI Ph.D. does not require any Qualifying Exams. Instead, a LTI Ph.D. student is required to demonstrate proficiency in the following four areas. \u2022 Writing: This is satisfied by producing a peer-reviewed conference paper, or the equivalent (a written report that at least two SCS faculty certify as being of conference-paper quality). \u2022 Presentation: This is satisfied by the oral presentation of a conference paper, or the equivalent (an oral presentation that at least t wo SCS faculty certify as being of conference-talk quality). \u2022 Programming: This is satisfied by demonstrating competence in computer programming of language technology; this is normally satisfied in the course of the student's research and/or project work", "LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook Page 16 \u2022 Teaching: This is satisfied by two (2) successful Teaching Assistantships ( TA-ships), as determined by the faculty member for whom the student serves as TA . Typically, one of these will be for an undergraduate class, and one for a graduate-level class. O ne of the two TA-ships may be in some form of pre-approved \"alternate service\", such as an SCS \u201cv-unit .\u201d The Program Coordinator must be notified in advance of a TA-ship, or it may not be accepted . Graduate students are required to have a certain level of fluency in English before they can instruct in Pennsylvania, as required by the English Fluency in Higher Education Act of 1990. Through this Act, all institutions of higher education in the state are required to evaluate and certify the English fluency of all instructional personnel, including teaching assistants and interns. The full university policy can be reviewed at: https://www.cmu.edu/policies/faculty/evaluation-certification-english-fluency-instructors.html The fluency of all instructional personnel will be rated by Language Support in the Student Academic Success Center to determine at what level of responsibility the student can TA. In addition to administering the International Teaching Assistant (ITA) Test (a mandatory screening test for any non-native speake r of English), Language Support in the Student Academic Success Center helps teaching assistants who are non-native English speakers develop fluency and cultural understanding to teach successfully at Carnegie Mellon. Visit the Student Academic Success Center website for additional information: https://www.cmu.edu/student-success/ 3.1.4 The Ph.D. Dissertation The Ph.D. dissertation is the defining feature of a Ph.D. degree. The process of completing a Ph.D. dissertation has three important milestones. \u2022 Thesis Topic : During the Ph.D. student\u2019s third year, the student should be working hard to find a thesis topic. The thesis topic typically develops from the directed research that the student has been carrying out with the student\u2019s advisor. The topic is a well-defined research proble m that is interesting and unsolved, and for which the student has a believable proposed solution. When the dissertation is finished, there will be a \u201cthesis statement\u201d that describes the claimed solution to the research problem that is the thesis topic. \u2022 Thesis Proposal: Near the end of the student\u2019s third year, the student will compose a dissertation proposal. In this document, the student will specify the problem the research addresses (the thesis topic); the significance of the problem and expected scie ntific contributions; other relevant research, including competing approaches; some preliminary results; the work that still must be completed; evaluation metrics for that work; and a", "LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook Page 17 projected timeline for completion. Before presenting the proposal, the student will also secure approval for a dissertation committee, which consists of the student\u2019s advisor, at least two other SCS faculty members working in language technologies, and at least one external member. University rules require that the time and place of the proposal presentation be publicly announced at least one week before the presentation. The student should coordinate this with the Ph.D. Program Coordinator. The public thesis proposal protects the student by guaranteeing that the proposed research is interesting to the larger scientific community and demonstrating that the student will finish the program if the work is completed as outlined. \u2022 Thesis Defense: The dissertation document itself, normally expected at the end of the fifth year, will include a detailed description of all the work done, including a clear evaluation and a discussion of its scientific contributions. There are no fixed style or document length guidelines or requirements; the only format requirement is that the title page should be suitable to be issued as an LTI Technical Report. The dissertation defense is a public presentation and defense of the dissertation results. Note: University rules again require that the time and place of the dissertation defense be publicly an nounced at least one week prior to the defense. This should also be coordinated with Ph.D. Program Coordinator. Note: At the time of the public announcement, a draft of the thesis document must be made available online. 3.1.5 Research Speaking Requirement To emphasize student research, improve public speaking skills and increase internal awareness of LTI work, all LTI Ph.D. students must complete an oral presentation at the LTI each year (by the end of May). The presentation should consist of a 20-minute ta lk plus time for discussion. It must be advertised to the LTI mailing lists at least one week before your presentation, and the public will be invited. (The thesis proposal and defense each count towards this requirement.) At least two LTI faculty members will attend the presentation, including the research advisor. After the presentation, these faculty members will convene and provide written feedback to both the student and the Program Director of graduate programs (the form for this is available on the LTI website). This feedback will help the student refine speaking skills with respect to talk structure, content, and delivery. 3.2 Advising Each student has a faculty advisor charged with guiding the education and monitoring the progress of the student through the program. The advisor also supervises the student's directed", "LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook Page 18 study projects. This personal student-advisor relationship ensures that every student receives the necessary faculty mentoring. The advisor also provides the student with career advice. How a nd when the advisor is selected (The Matching Process) : Advisors are selected during the first month of the program. Students are expected to attend the LTI's Orientation lectures, (Section 3.3) in which faculty describe their interests and areas of expertise, and to be proactive about meeting individually with potential advisors. After meeting with several potential advisors, each student will be asked to indicate a first, second and third choice for advisor. Meanwhile, the potential advisors determine how many new students they can take and indicate their preferences. Finally, the entire LTI faculty meets as a \" Matching Committee\" to determine the best set of matches. Until a student finds a specific advisor, the Progr am Director of the LTI graduate programs serves as the advisor. How to change advisors: The initial advisor selection should be made carefully. However, it is possible to change advisors. To do so, the student should find another faculty member willing to serve as an advisor, and then make a request to the Program Director to switch advisors. The LTI follows the long-standing SCS policy that both the new and old advisors need to agree to the change; typically, this is not a problem (assuming the new advisor has agreed in advance, as described here). It is to the student's advantage to avoid switching advisors, especially late in their graduate studies, because forging a strong student-advisor relationship takes time. 3.3 LTI Orientation At the beginning of each Fall semester, the LTI provides 2-3 weeks of lectures and talks to help students learn about the work done by CMU faculty and to provide an opportunity for advisors to recruit new students. Students are expected to attend them and treat them as seriously a s a standard course, because they provide a good introduction to the broad range of research done at the LTI. Students do not register for the LTI Orientation, nor do they receive a grade; however, the department is serious about its expectation that new students will attend these talks. For many years, these talks were called \"the Immigration Course (IC).\" The intuition behind this name is that the talks help orient newly-arrived students \u2013 immigrants into the CMU environment. As a result, some students u nderstood the name to indicate that the talks would be about US immigration and visa requirements. The older name has been retired; however, people who have been at CMU a long time may occasionally use the older name . 3.4 End of Semester Evaluation Near the e nd of each semester, the student must prepare a statement that describes his or her achievements in the current semester and plans for the next semester. At the end of the semester, the faculty evaluates each student's academic progress. The student's advisor serves as the student's advocate in this process. The result of the evaluation is a letter from", "LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook Page 19 the faculty to the student that indicates whether the student is making satisfactory progress towards completing the degree. A good letter typically indicates that the student is making satisfactory progress. If the student is doing exceptionally good work, a stronger adjective such as excellent might be used, but this is unusual. If a student seems to be having trouble, the faculty determines whether it believes that the student can finish the degree, and if so, what needs to be accomplished to get back on track. This type of letter should be considered a serious warning. It is not a permanent \"black mark\" on the student's record; if the student begins makin g satisfactory progress again, there is no official record of the letter in the student's transcript. In the most serious cases, the faculty gives the student an \u201cN-1\u201d letter that specifies a list of conditions that the student must satisfy by specific deadlines. Failure to meet all t he specified conditions may result in the student's termination from the program. 3.5 Electives Outside of SCS Students may take elective courses outside the SCS, at Carnegie Mellon or cross-registered at the University of Pittsburgh, as long as the student fulfills the requirements of their program as described above. The student should discuss any such electives in advance w ith their advisor . Typical choices might include ECE courses for Speech students, Pitt Linguistics courses, or Statistics courses. Students interested in taking recommended electives outside the SCS should pay particular attention to the following issues. \u2022 Recommended electives outside of the SCS count towards the \u201cSCS\u201d course requirement. Please see the Program Director for approval of an elective as an \u201cSCS course\u201d . \u2022 Students need advance approval for any courses not covered by their normal tuition (e.g., summer courses). \u2022 The grading of outside courses is the responsibility of the department offering the course; however, the LTI's Minimum Course Grade Policy described above still applies (\u201cB\u201d is the minimum for Ph.D. ). 3.6 Completing a n M.S. Degree Enroute t o a Ph.D. Courses that satisfy LTI Ph.D. degree requirements may also be used to satisfy requirements for one M.S. degree. The most common choice is the LTI\u2019s Master of Language Technologies (MLT) degree because its requirements are similar (but not identical) to the Ph.D. requirements. Other M.S. degrees within the LTI and outside of the LTI are also possible", "LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook Page 20 Students interested in an M.S. degree other than the MLT degree should discuss their plans with their Ph.D. advisor due to the additional courses and project work that may be involved. 3.7 Grading and Evaluation 3.7.1 University Policy on Grades Carnegie Mellon\u2019s Grading policy offers details concerning university grading principles for students taking courses and covers the specifics of assigning and c hanging grades, grading options, drop/ withdrawals, and course repeats. It also defines the undergraduate and graduate grading standards. Process for Appealing Final Grades Final grades will be changed only in exceptional circumstances and only with the approval of the instructor and the department, unit, or program. Grading is a matter of sound discretion of the instructor and final grades are rarely changed without the consent of the instructor who assigned the grade. The following circumstances are the unusual exceptions that may warrant a grade appeal: (a) the final grade assigned for a course is based on manifest error (e.g., a clear error such as arithmetic error in computing a grade or failure to grade one of the answers on an exam), or (b) the faculty or staff member who assigned the grade did so in violation of a university policy. See the university\u2019s Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures web page for more information. https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/academic/appeal-of-grades-and-academic-actions.html 3.7.2 University Policy on Grades for Transfer Courses https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/transfer-credit-evaluation-and-assignment.html Carnegie Mellon University offers students the opportunity to take courses for credit through a cross-registration program (see Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE) and Cross-registration below) and through the receipt of transfer credit from othe r accredited institutions. The Carnegie Mellon University transcript will include information on such courses as follows: Carnegie Mellon courses and courses taken through the university's cross-registration program will have grades recorded on the transcr ipt and be factored into the QPA. All other courses will be recorded on this transcript indicating where the course was taken, but without grade. Such courses will not be taken into account for academic actions, honors or QPA calculations", "LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook Page 21 3.8 Academic Integrity In the midst of self-exploration, the high demands of a challenging academic environment can create situations where some students have difficulty exercising good judgment. Academic challenges can provide many opportunities for high standards to evolv e if students actively reflect on these challenges and if the community supports discussions to aid in this process. It is the responsibility of the entire community to establish and maintain the integrity of our university. Carnegie Mellon University edu cates its students to become professionals who will serve society with integrity. The university also creates and disseminates new knowledge and expressions of knowledge in ways that benefit society. Carnegie Mellon strives to serve the changing needs of society through the three primary goals outlined in its mission statement: T o create and disseminate knowledge and art through research and artistic expression, teaching and learning and transfer to society; to serve students by teaching them leadership, problem-solving skills, and the values of quality, ethical behavior, responsibility to society and commitments to work; and to pursue the advantages provided by a diverse community, open to the exchange of ideas, where discovery and artistic creativity can flourish. In any presentation, creative, artistic or research, it is the ethical responsibility of each student to identify the conceptual sources of the work submitted. Failure to do so is dishonest and is the basis for a charge of cheating or plagiarism, which is subject to disciplinary action. Please review the University Policy on Academic Integrity . The policy includes the University expectations around academic integrity and provides definitions of cheating, plagiarism, and unauthorized assistance. A review of the University\u2019s Academic Disciplinary Actions procedures is also recommended. Important note: The LTI implements the above policy\u2019s option of \u201cconven[ing] a disciplinary hearing according to the procedures of the department/program.\u201d Our procedure is as follows: A first violation is grounds for dismissal from the graduate program. If we decide not to immediately dismiss, the first violation will result in the student being on disciplinary probation. If the student commits a second violation while on probation, the penalty is dismissal from the graduate program. These procedures outline the process for investigating, reporting, and adjudicating violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity. The procedures also outline the appeal process. Please see the Appeals of Course Level Action section of The Word and the Office of Community Standards & Integrity w eb page for more information", "LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook Page 22 3.9 Withdrawal of a Degree The University reserves the right to withdraw a degree even though it has been granted should there be discovery that the work upon which it was based or the academic records in support of it had been falsified. In such a case, withdrawal of the degree will occur promptly upon discovery of the falsification. See the university\u2019s Withdrawal of a Degree policy for more information. 3.10 Employment Eligibility Verification If you are receiving a stipend, are a TA, or are planning to have a position with CMU then Employment Eligibility Verification is required. Form I-9 must be completed within 3 business days of beginning work for any type of compensation (stipend or employment). Additional details are highlighted below. To ensure compliance with federal law, Carnegie Mellon University maintains the Employment Eligibility Verification (I-9) Policy [pdf] covering the university\u2019s I-9 and E-Verify requirements : \u2022 Every individual receiving a stipend from CMU or employed by CMU must comply with the I-9 Policy by completing the Form I-9 within three business days following the first day of stipend start date/employment. \u2022 Individuals who expect to work on a federally funded project are further responsible for submitting an E-Verify Processing Request Form to the Office of Human Resources if required. \u2022 For more information, please see CMU\u2019s Guidance for Completing the Form I-9 and E-Verify Requirements at CMU [pdf] , or visit the Human Resources Service website to learn more about Form I-9 and E-Verify and to schedule an appointment to complete the Form I-9. \u2022 Students who fail to complete the Form I-9 in a timely manner may have stipend payments suspended. If employed by the university, an individual who fails to timely complete the Form I-9 may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment. For more information : \u2022 See CMU\u2019s Guidance for Completing the Form I-9 and E-Verify Requirements at CMU , or \u2022 Visit the Human Resources Service website to learn more about Form I-9 and E-Verify and to schedule an appointment to complete the Form I-9.\u201d 3.11 Additional Guidance for Students", "LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook Page 23 3.11.1 Program of Study Students seeking guidance about their program of study and degree requirements should consult with their academic advisor and/or appropriate associate dean. 3.11.2 Financial Aid and Student Account Students are expected to make normal progress toward their degree in order to graduate within the standard timeframe for their program of study. Under U.S. Federal Title IV regulations, student eligibility for federal financial aid is contingent upon enrollment in and successful completion of courses that are counted as credit toward their current degree program. To receive the maximum amount of federal financial aid for which they may be eligible, students must enroll each se mester in at least 36 units that count toward their current degree level. (See separate guidance regarding integrated degree completion.) Students should consult with their designated college liaison in The HUB regarding billing and financial aid, particu larly for early completion, longer-than-standard completion, or integrated undergraduate and master\u2019s degree programs. 3.11.3 International Students Immigration status for students in F-1 and J-1 non-immigrant status is tied to making normal progress toward completing degree requirements. Therefore, F-1 and J-1 students who are considering completing their degree requirements early, anticipating longer-than-standard completion, or moving from an undergraduate to a graduate student classification (integ rated undergraduate-graduate study) should consult with their designated advisor in the Office of International Education (OIE) to ensure compliance with immigration regulations. 4 Ph.D. Academic Policies 4.1 Duration of Study The target duration of the LTI Ph.D. is five years, although six years is also common. Carnegie Mellon graduate students are expected to complete their degree requirements within the standard length of time for their program of study as outlined in this Graduate Student Handbook. Upon completion of the graduate program degree requirements, the degree will be certified by the student\u2019s academic program in the semester in which the student completes the requirements. Early Completion The Ph.D. is granted when all degree requirements are satisfied. Some students complete the program in fewer than five years", "LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook Page 24 Extended or Longer-than-Standard Competition Longer-than-standard degree completion may occur due to academic interruptions in making progress toward the d egree as defined by the academic program, interruptions of full-time study or progress towards the degree due to serious, documented medical issues, or other unusual or unforeseen circumstances. Doctoral students who require an extended period to complete their degree requirements must consult with their academic program and are subject to the CMU Policy on Doctoral Student Status (https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/doctoral-student-status.html), specifically the \u201cTime to Degree. \u201d 4.1.1 Departm ent Policy on Double Counting Courses An LTI Ph.D. student who uses courses taken as a M aster \u2019s degree student (at Carnegie Mellon or elsewhere) toward their program requirements cannot use those same courses toward any other Master\u2019s degree offered by the school . The LTI (like other SCS units) allows its Ph.D. students who have passed the requirements for an LTI Master\u2019s degree to receive the master\u2019s degree without any additional work. Any other sharing of coursework by an LTI student between more than on e CMU degree (e.g., receiving an MLD Master\u2019s degree that includes courses taken as an LTI Ph.D. student) must be explicitly approved by the LTI, on a case-by-case basis, in advance. 4.1.2 External Internships The LTI provides summer support for its Ph.D. students, so Ph.D. students are expected to do research at Carnegie Mellon during the summer. However, outside experience can be a valuable educational experience, Ph.D. students in good standing are allowed to do an e xternal internship. Some students may benefit from more than one internship, especially if they require access to proprietary data for their work, thus , with the approval of the student\u2019s advisor, a student can intern up to four (4) times during their Ph.D. degree. Interning more than four ( 4) times requires approval from the Ph.D. P rogram Director. Any internship must be planned in consultation with the student\u2019s advisor and the LTI Ph.D. Coordinator. If an internship is part of a fully-funded external fellowship (e.g., Microsoft Research Fellowship), the student does not need prior LTI approval, but should still coordinate with their advisor. International students must consult with Office of International Education (OIE) for eligibility before seeking an internship or signing an offer contract. Internships are typically scheduled during the summer. In certain cases, it is possible to schedule an internship during the fall or spring semester; the details are complex, especially for international students, so the student should discuss this as early as possible with the Ph.D. Program Director . International students must coordinate carefully with the LTI in any event, due to visa restrictions", "LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook Page 25 Note that self-funded Ph.D. students (e.g., those registered for five units while on semester interns hip) are not permitted to receive a partial stipend for the semester of their internship, while full-time LTI-sponsored students are eligible for a partial stipend. All students are caution ed to be aware of potential intellectual property (IP) problems with internships, and to review any IP agreements with their advisors before signing them. It is possible to lose ownership of your ideas. If the student is to receive academic credit for the internship, it must have deliverables from the student commensurate with the number of units, they are taking. This can be in the form of interim and final reports on the experience, presentations in the following semester regarding the experience, assessments of their experience as it relates to their course of study, etc. 4.1.3 Maximum Courseload Ph.D. students are permitted to register for a maximum of 54 units of coursework per semester. 4.1.4 Pass/Fail Grades Pass/fail grades are not permitted for courses used to satisfy a degree requirement. Graduate students who are required to take additional undergraduate courses to build up the core foundations of computer science may not elect the pass/fail option for th ese courses. 4.1.5 Transfer Credit An equivalent graduate course previously completed at another institution may be permitted to satisfy one of the Ph.D. course requirements. The decision on whether a course may be transferred is made by the Ph.D. Program Direct or. Typically, the student will provide the Program Director with the syllabus of the external course, and the Program Director will use that and the student\u2019s transcript to make the decision. See the section on \u201cDefinition of transfer credit versus cour se exemption .\u201d A student may not receive transfer credit for more than four courses. 4.1.6 Residency Requirements The university requires Ph.D. s to spend at least one year of residency at Carnegie Mellon. The SCS requires that all Ph.D. students must take at Carnegie Mellon a minimum of 48 units of the total coursework required by their respective programs", "LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook Page 26 4.1.7 Transferring Into the Ph.D. Program The LTI does not allow direct transfers from its master\u2019s programs into its Ph.D. program . The student must apply for the Ph.D. at the usual time . However, students that are already enrolled in an LTI degree program are not required to retake GRE and TOEFL exams or to produce new transcripts from other universities. 4.1.8 Transferring Out of the Ph.D. Program The Ph.D. program doe s not prevent students from transferring to another degree program . A student who is interested in transferring out of the Ph.D. degree program should consult the handbook and Program Director of the desired degree program to learn whether transfers are permitted, and if so, how, and when to request such a transfer. 4.2 LTI Academic Policies 4.2.1 \u201cGrandfather\u201d Policy A student can graduate under the policies in effect at the time that the student entered the program; or, at the student's choice, the student can graduate under policies that are adopted after the student entered the program. If it is not realistic to follow a particular policy exactly, the department may approximate the policy as closely as possible; this situation is rare and typically arises only when a student is enrolled in the program for an extended period of time. 4.2.2 Definition of Transfer Credit vs. Course Exemption The LT I may grant transfer credit or issue an exemption for equivalent graduate courses previously completed at another institution. This decision rests with the director of the particular program. If a student is exempt from a required course due to prior cour ses or experience, the student can replace that course with an open elective. The student does not receive credit for the external course but can take any course that could normally count toward the degree in its place. If a student receives credit for pr ior coursework completed at CMU or elsewhere, the student receives that many units of credit, and the total amount of required coursework is reduced by that amount. 4.2.3 External Employment/Consulting Students funded by LTI research projects are expected to wor k primarily for those projects. Since consulting provides useful experience, students are generally permitted to consult at most one day per seven-day week, with the advisor's consent . International students must also have approval in advance from the Office of International Education (OIE) ; otherwise, they may be in violation of their visa status. See also External Internships", "LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook Page 27 4.2.4 Leave of Absence The LTI discourages Leaves of Absence (LOA), since students usually do not return, despite good intentions. However, a student in good standing may be granted a LOA of at most 1 year, upon written request to the Ph.D. Program Director and with consent of t he student's advisor. It is the responsibility of the student on LOA to contact the LTI to initiate a return to the program. Students taking or returning from a leave of absence must follow the university\u2019s leave of absence process. 4.2.5 Satisfactory Progress If a student does not make satisfactory progress each semester toward completing the degree, the LTI may remove the m from the program . See section on \u201cEnd of Semester Evaluation .\u201d 4.2.6 Time Away from Academic Responsibilities Ph.D. s tudents that are supported by sponsored research, fellowships, or scholarships are expected to remain on campus and work fu lltime on their education and research throughout the year, regardless of whether classes are in session or not. 40 hours per week is a common level of effort. Ordinarily, students are not expected to work during official university holidays , however students may need to consult their advisor about expectations and alternate arrangements if there are challenges with taking time off during a university holiday, for example, if an experiment requires continuous monitoring. In such situations, the student and their advisor may agree for the student to take an equal number of days off at another time. Students with fulltime financial support are entitled to four weeks per year of paid vacation , which must be scheduled in consultation with the ir advisor . 4.3 CMU Academic Policies 4.3.1 Drop/Add/Withdraw Procedures Add, drop, withdrawals, and pass/no pass election procedures and deadlines are described on a Hub web page . Note that the deadlines for doctoral courses may differ slightly; see the deadlines for doctoral course sections in the Academic Calendar . Doctoral students, visiting/non-degree students, and certificate students do not receive vouchers and do not participate in the voucher process", "LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook Page 28 4.3.2 Doctoral Student Status Carnegie Mellon\u2019s Policy for Doctoral Student Status covers time limits on doctoral degree student status, a defi nition of All But Dissertation status, a definition of In Residence (ABD) and In Absentia (ABS) status for doctoral students and the tuition and fees charged for students In Residence and students In Absentia . 4.3.3 ABD versus ABD in Absentia (ABS) Following university policy, an LTI Ph.D. student is considered \"All-But-Dissertation\" (ABD) when they have completed all requirements for the LTI's Ph.D. degree except for the thesis defense (in particular, the student has had a thesis proposal accepted). Note that ABD status is different from ABD in absentia (ABS) status. A student in ABS status cannot receive any support from the university (including an y research projects within the university), cannot use most university facilities, and does not pay any tuition until they are ready to defend their thesis. ABS students must register for five (5) units of dissertation research in the semester they defend; in keeping with university policy, the LTI (and its projects and faculty) cannot pay for these five units. The student can (and should) register for these five units only after they defend; just in case the defense date slips to the next semester. Student s entering ABD or ABS status must complete the All But Dissertations Status Agreement . 4.3.4 Statute of Limitations: Time to Degree As outlined in the Doctoral Student Status Policy , students will complete all requirements for the Ph.D. degree within a maximum of ten years from original matriculation as a doctoral student, or less if required by a more restrictive department or college policy. Once this time-to-degree limit has lapsed, the person may resume work towards a doctoral degree only if newly admitted to a currently offered doctoral degree program under criteria determined by that program. Under extraordinary circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, family or parental leave, or temporary disability, a school or college may, upon the relevant departmen t's recommendation and with the written approval of the dean, defer the lapse of All But Dissertation status for a period commensurate with the duration of that interruption. Students, who are pursuing the Ph.D. degree as part-time students for all semesters of their program, as approved by their program, may also appeal to their program or department for extension of the time to degree limit. Under extraordinary circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, family or parental leave, or temporary disability, a school or college may, upon the relevant department\u2019s recommendation and with the written approval of the dean, defer the lapse of All But Dissertation status for a period commensurate with the duration of that interruption", "LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook Page 29 Students, who are pursuing the Ph.D. degree as part-time students for all semesters of their program, as approved by their program, may also appeal to their program or department for extension of the time to degree limit. 4.3.5 University Financial Aid Graduate students should consult the graduate student financial aid information found on The HUB website. Students will find the Graduate Financial Aid Guide, information about funding options and how to apply for financial aid and other helpful links. 4.3.6 Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities The Office of Disability Resources at Carnegie Mellon University has a continued mission to provide physical, digital, and programmatic access to ensure that students with disabilities have equal access to their educational experience. We work to ensure that qualified individuals receive reasonable accommodations as guaranteed by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Students who would like to receive accommodations can begin the process through Disability Resources' secu re online portal (https://rainier.accessiblelearning.com/cmu/ ) or email access@andrew.cmu.edu to begin the interactive accommodation process. Students with physical, sensory, cognitive, or emotional disabilities are encouraged to self-identify with the Office of Disability Resources and request needed accommodations. Any questions about the process can be directed to access@andrew.cmu.edu , or call (412) 268-6121. 4.3.7 Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures Graduate students will find the Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures on the Graduate Education Resource webpage. This document summarizes processes available to graduate students who seek review of academic and non-academic issues. Generally, graduate students are expected to seek informal resolution of all concerns within the applicable department, unit, or program before invok ing formal processes. When an informal resolution cannot be reached, however, a graduate student who seeks further review of the matter is to follow the formal procedures outlined here . These appeal and grievance procedures shall apply to students in all graduate programs of the University. Students should refer to the department specific information in this handbook for department and college information about the administration and academic policies of the program. 4.3.8 Sexual Misconduct Policy The University prohibits sex-based discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating/ domestic violence, and stalking. The University also prohibits retaliation against individuals who bring forward such concerns or allegations in good faith", "LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook Page 30 The University\u2019s S exual Misconduct Policy is available at https://www.cmu.edu/policies/administrative-and-governance/sexual-misconduct/index.html The University\u2019s Policy Against Retaliation is available at : https://www.cmu.edu/policies/administrative-and-governance/whistleblower.html If you have been impacted by any of these issues, you are encouraged to make contact with any of the following resources: \u2022 Office for Institutional Equity and Title IX : 412-268-7125, institutionalequity@cmu.edu \u2022 On campus resources for institutional equity and Title IX \u2022 University Police : 412-268-2323 Additional resources and information can be found at: https://www.cmu.edu/title-ix/resources-and-information/index.html 4.3.9 Gestational and Parental Accommodations Providing holistic student support is a top priority at Carnegie Mellon. The protocols described at https://www.cmu.edu/graduate/programs-services/maternity-accommodation-protocol.html are designed to support the parental needs of students and their families. Students seeking any of the Parental Accommodations described below must register with the Office of the Dea n of Students by contacting the office for an appointment by calling 412-268-2075. Students are encouraged to register with the Office of the Dean of Students ninety (90) days in advance of the anticipated arrival of the child as applicable in the individual circumstance. At the time of registering, students will have the opportunity to consult about resources, procedures, funding options and preparation for discussing academic accommodations with the student\u2019s academic department. Students should also co nsult with their academic advisors either before or in conjunction with registering with the Office of the Dean of Students. 4.3.10 Accommodations for Gestational Parents The birth of a child is a significant life event that may require time away from academic pu rsuits for delivery and recovery from delivery of a newly born child. Students whose anticipated delivery date is during the course of a semester may need to take time away from their academic responsibilities. Carnegie Mellon students seeking time away are afforded two options as possible accommodation: \u2022 Short-Term Accommodation for Gestational Parents \u2013 A short term absence from academic responsibilities up to a maximum of six (6) weeks. Short-Term Accommodation", "LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook Page 31 may be extended by two (2) weeks, for a tot al of eight (8) weeks, where a longer absence is medically necessary. Prior to the absence students must work with relevant university faculty and staff to adjust their course work, research, teaching and other academic responsibilities during the period of absence. This may include extensions of time to complete assignments, incomplete grades, and/or dropping courses, shifting research responsibilities and adjusting TA assignments. Students who take a Short-Term Accommodation will remain enrolled. \u2022 Formal Leave of Absence \u2013 A formal leave of absence under the Student Leave Policy. Generally, the Student Leave Policy permits students to take a leave of absence for a full-semester, mini-semester, or for the time remaining in the semester during which the leave is taken. Students who take a Formal Leave of Absence (https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/student-leave.html ) drop all remaining courses for the semester and are unenrolled for the semester. International students must consult with the Office of International Education (https://www.cmu.edu/oie/ ) before considering this option due to visa implications. 4.3.11 Parental Accommodation for Doctoral Students The university offers a Parental Accommodation for qualifying doctoral student parents to include up to four (4) weeks of time away from academic responsibilities with continued stipend support. This accommodation can be utilized within six months of the birth or placement of a child through adoption, foster care or legal guardianship. Gestational parents may utilize both the Short-Term Accommodation for Gestational Parents and the parental accommodation. Careful planning and consultation is necessary given the unique contexts and requirements of each student\u2019s situation. Students will remain fully enrolled and will receive assistance in navigating the necessary planning and consultation processes. 4.3.12 Financial Assistance for Student Parents Carnegie Mellon also offers the following options for financial assistance to students who become parents while enrolled: Interest Free Loan \u2013 Any student who becomes a parent is eligible to apply for an interest-free parental loan (https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/dean/loans/ ) from the Office of the Dean of Students. Doctoral Stipend Continuation (Gestational Parents) \u2013 Doctoral students who are the gestational parent and who receive an academic stipend funded by Carnegie Mellon are eligible to continue to receive stipend funding for up to six (6) weeks during a Short-Term Accommodation for Gestational Parents or during a Formal Leave of Absence. Continued", "LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook Page 32 academic stipend funding may be extended by two (2) weeks, for a total of eight (8) weeks, if an absence longer than six weeks is medically necessary. Doctoral Sti pend Continuation (Non-gestational Parents) \u2013 Doctoral students who receive an academic stipend funded by Carnegie Mellon and are becoming a parent by adoption, birth, or through guardianship are eligible to continue to receive stipend funding for up to fo ur (4) weeks during a Short-Term Parental Accommodation. 4.3.13 Consensual Intimate Relationship Policy Regarding Undergraduate Students This policy addresses the circumstances in which romantic, sexual or amorous relationships/interactions with undergraduate students, even if consensual, are inappropriate and prohibited. The purpose of this policy is to assure healthy professional relationships. This policy is not intended to discourage consensual intimate relationships unless there is a conflicting professional relationship in which one party has authority over the other as in the policy. https://www.cmu.ed u/policies/student-and-student-life/consensual-relationships.html 5 Financial Support 5.1 Graduate Student Funding For all LTI Ph.D. students, full funding (tuition plus stipend) is guaranteed for the first year . This support is normally continued for at least 5 years, with possibility of further continuance, subject to continuing satisfactory progress and availability of funding. The fellowship includes full tuition and fees, and a monthly Ph.D. stipend that is fixed across SCS. In addition, the LTI pays a dependency allowance of 10% of the student's monthly stipend to any student with a child, unless they have a spouse who earns more than $200 per month. The impact of outside fellowships and scholarships on departmental support-decrease by the amount, added bonus, etc. If a Ph.D. student receives an outside graduate fellowship (e.g., NSF, Fulbright), the student is expected to accept it in place of the LTI\u2019s graduate fellowship. As an extra incentive to do so, the LTI will supplement the award so that the student will receive full tuition and a combined stipend 10 percent higher than that of the standard LTI graduate fellowship. Studen ts are required to inform the LTI about any external funding that they receive. See also the section on \u201cABD versus ABD in Absentia (ABS) \u201d (Section 4.3.3 ). 5.2 Conference Travel Funding", "LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook Page 33 Students funded by research projects receive travel funding according to policies set by the individual projects. Students who have no project funding may be provided with partial funding, with a larger amount available for travel to p resent a refereed conference paper . There is an LTI form that must be filled out in advance. 5.3 Research Funding GuSH Research Funding is a source of small research grant funds provided by the Graduate Student Assembly (GSA) and the Provost\u2019s Office and manag ed by the Office of Graduate and Postdoc Affairs.

the Language Technologies Institute. While this handbook (and your college graduate student handbook) is specific to your academic experience in the LTI, there are several other resources and offices that graduate students are encouraged to consult during their tenure at Carnegie Mellon University. Information about The Word, the student handbook, the Office of Graduate and Postdoc Affairs, the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs, and others, are included in Appendix A of this handbook. 1.2 The MLT Degree The Master of Language Technologies (MLT) is a research-oriented Master of Science degree offered by the Language Technologies Institute (LTI), a graduate department in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. The MLT program is a 24-month program consisting of courses, directed research, and an optional Masters ' Thesis. Typical research areas include speech processing, information retrieval, machine translation, natural language processing, machine learning, and computational biology. Many MLT graduates continue on to PhD programs in the LTI or other leading universities. Other graduates go on to work in the computer industry, many at major corporate research laboratories. There are significant differences between CMU's different departments and degree programs in philosophical approach, procedures, policies , and regulations. Each departm ent issues a handbook that informs graduate students of their program requirements and procedures and ensures that students have written access to the standard information outlined below. This handbook describes the policies, procedures, and requirements for the Master of Language Technologies (MLT) degree. While this handbook is specific to your academic experience in the department, there are several other resources and offices graduate students are encouraged to consult during their tenure at Carnegie Me llon University. Information about The Word, Carnegie Mellon University Student Handbook , the Office of the Assistant Vice Provost for Graduate Education, the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs and others are included in Appendix A of this handbook.

Please see Appendix A for additional information about The Word and other university resources. 1.5 Carnegie Mellon University Statement of Assurance Carnegie Mellon University does not discriminate in admission, employment or administration of its programs or activities on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, handicap or disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status or genetic information. Furthermore, Carnegie Mellon University does not discriminate and is required not to discriminate in violation of federal, state or local laws or executive orders. Inquiries concerning the application of and compliance with this statement should be directed to the university ombudsman, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, telephone 412-268-1018. Obtain general information about Carnegie Mellon University by calling 41 2-268-2000. Carnegie Mellon University publishes an annual campus security and fire safety report describing the university's security, alcohol and drug, sexual assault and fire safety policies, and containing statistics about the number and type of crimes committed on the campus, and the number and cause of fires in campus residence facilities during the preceding three years. You can obtain a copy by contacting the Carnegie Mellon Police Department at 412-268-2323. The annual security and fire safety report also is available online at www.cmu.edu/police/annualreports. Information regarding the application of Title IX, including to admission and employment decisions, the sexual misconduct grievance procedures and process, including how to file a report or a complaint of sex discrimination, how to file a report of sexual harassment, and how", "MLT Graduate Student Handbook Page 9 the university responds to such reports is available at www.cmu.edu/title-ix. The Title IX coordinator may be reached at 5000 Forbes Ave., 140 Cyert Hall, Pittsburgh, PA 1 5213; 412-268-7125; or tix@cmu.edu. 1.6 The Carnegie Mellon Code Students at Carnegie Mellon, because they are members of an academic community dedicated to the achievement of excellence, are expected to meet the highest standards of personal, ethical and moral conduct possible. These standards require personal integrity, a commitment to honesty without compromise, as well as truth without equivocation and a willingness to place the good of the community above the good of the self. Obligations once undertaken must be met, commitments kept. As members of the Carnegie Mellon community, individuals are expected to uphold the standards of the community in addition to holding others accountable for said standards. It is rare that the life of a student in an academic community can be so private that it will not affect the community as a whole or that the above standards do not apply. The discovery, advancement and communication of knowledge are not possible without a commitment to these standards. Creativity cannot exist without acknowledgment of the creativity of others. New knowledge cannot be developed without credit for prior knowledge. Without the ability to trust that these principles will be observed, an academic community cannot exist. The commitment of its faculty, staff and students to these standards contributes to the high respect in which the Carnegie Mellon degree is held. Students must not destroy that respect by their failure to meet these standards. Students who cannot meet them should voluntarily withdraw from the university. The Carnegie Mellon Code can also be found on-line at http://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/code.html 1.7 Vision Carnegie Mell on University will have a transformative impact on society through continual innovation in education, research, creativity, and entrepreneurship", "MLT Graduate Student Handbook Page 10 1.8 Mission To create a transformative educational experience for students focused on deep disciplinary knowl edge; problem solving; leadership, communication, and interpersonal skills; and personal health and well-being. To cultivate a transformative university community dedicated to a) attracting and retaining diverse, world-class talent; b) creating a collaborative environment open to the free exchange of ideas, where research, creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship can flourish; and c) ensuring individuals can achieve their full potential. To impact society in a transformative way \u2014regionally, nationally, and globally \u2014by engaging with partners outside the traditional borders of the university campus. 1.9 Consensual Intimate Relationship Policy Regarding Undergraduate Students This policy addresses the circumstances in which romantic, sexual, or amorous relation ships/interactions with undergraduate students, even if consensual, are inappropriate and prohibited. The purpose of this policy is to assure healthy professional relationships. This policy is not intended to discourage consensual intimate relationships unless there is a conflicting professional relationship in which one party has authority over the other as in the policy. https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/consensual-relationships.html 2 The Language Technologies Institute 2.1 Mailboxes & Office Supplies Mailboxes, printers, copiers, and other departmental resources are in GHC 5404. 2.2 Photocopies and Printers The use of a photocopier or printer requires you to log in with your CMU ID card. LTI\u2019s printers are located in GHC 5404 and GHC 66 04. The School of Computer Science provides a number of black-and-white and color printers for use by students. The SCS Computer Facilities publishes a list of printers online at http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~help/printing/ ", "MLT Graduate Student Handbook Page 11 2.3 Office Space for MS Students To help them create a sense of com munity, full time students in the LTI\u2019s MLT program have access to a shared office space . 2.4 Computers for MS Students Students are expected to provide their own laptop computers that can be used to access university resources an d complete course assignments. Laptops running Windows, MacOS, and Linux software are all acceptable. MS students will be given a CS user ID . A CS user ID is required to use the LTI computer cluster, department printers, and other SCS services. The School of Computer Science has a Help Center located at 4203 GHC. They can be contacted at help@cs.cmu.edu, extension 8-4231 from a campus phone, or 412-268-4231 from an outside line. MS students will be given access to the LTI\u2019s computer cluster on an as-needed basis, to be used for course assignments, directed study projects , and/or capstone projects. The LTI cluster provides storage and computation for projects involving large datasets and/or lengthy computation. 3 Master\u2019s Degree Completion and Certification 3.1 Standard Degree Requirements an d Degree Certification 3.1.1 Graduate Students Carnegie Mellon graduate students are expected to complete their degree requirements within the standard length of time for their program of study as outlined in the relevant Graduate Student Handbook. Standard prog ram lengths for graduate students vary significantl y--ranging from two semesters for some full-time master\u2019s programs to several or more years for doctoral programs. Upon completion of the graduate program degree requirements, the degree will be certified by the student\u2019s academic program in the semester in which the student completes the requirements. 3.1.2 Early Completion Graduate students who consider the completion of all degree requirements in less than the standard length of time for their program of study may consult with their degree-granting program or department to determine if early degree certification is allowed and under what circumstances", "MLT Graduate Student Handbook Page 12 3.1.3 Extended or Longer-than-Standard Completion (Statute of Limitations) Longer-than-standard degree completion may occur due to academic interruptions in making progress toward the degree as defined by the academic program, interruptions of full-time study or progress towards the degree due to serious, documented medical iss ues, or other unusual or unforeseen circumstances. Master\u2019s students who require longer than the standard time to complete their degree requirements are expected to remain in close contact with their graduate program, and will be certified at the end of the semester in which they have completed their degree requirements. Students shall reference CMU Policy on Master\u2019s Student Statute of Limitations (www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of limitations.html) regarding gu idelines and restrictions which place an upper limit on the maximum length of time allowable for master\u2019s degree completion and certification. 3.1.4 Additional Guidance for Students \u2022 Program of Study: Students seeking guidance about their program of study and degree requirements should consult with their academic advisor and/ or appropriate associate dean. \u2022 Financial Aid and Student Account: Students are expected to make normal progress toward their degree to graduate within the standard timeframe for their program of study. Under U.S. Federal Title IV regulations, student eligibility for federal financial aid is contingent upon enrollment in and successful completion of courses that are counted as credit toward their current degree program. To receive the maximum amount of federal financial aid for which they may be eligible, students must enroll each semester in at least 36 units that count toward their current degree level. (See separate guidance regarding integrated degree completion.) Students s hould consult with their designated college liaison in The HUB regarding billing and financial aid, particularly for early completion, longer-than standard completion, or integrated undergraduate and master\u2019s degree programs . \u2022 International Students: Im migration status for students in F-1 and J-1 non-immigrant status is tied to making normal progress toward completing degree requirements . Therefore, F-1 and J-1 students who are considering completing their degree requirements early, anticipating longer-than-standard completion, or moving from an undergraduate to a graduate student classification ( integrated undergraduate-graduate study) should consult with their designated advisor in the Office of International Education (OIE) to ensure compliance wi th immigration regulations", "MLT Graduate Student Handbook Page 13 4 MLT Degree Attainment 4.1 Course Requirements In order to complete the Master of Language Technologies degree, the student must pass 120 or more course units of senior-to-graduate courses, and meet the following criteria: \u2022 within those 120 units, at least 72 units of \u201cLTI\u201d courses and 24 units of \u201cSCS\u201d courses, \u2022 within those 72 units, 11-711, 11-791 (or an equivalent , see below ), and one ``Task Orientation Focus'' class, and \u2022 within those 72 units, at least one of the following: o an LTI lab course, o 11-792, or o project-oriented Masters \u2019 thesis; \u2022 Of the remaining 24 unit s, 12 must be 11-910 Directed Research ; \u2022 The final 12 units are an Open Elective. The student must also complete two summers of full-time directed research, attend the LTI Colloquium (11-700) each semester, and satisfy the Research Speaking Requirement desc ribed elsewhere. Since 11-791 is not being offered currently, the faculty have defined a list of acceptable substitute courses: \u2022 11-727: Computational Semantics for NLP ( only if the course project was done as a group project) \u2022 11-731: Machine Translation \u2022 11-747: Neural Networks for NLP \u2022 11-751: Speech Recognition \u2022 11-775: Large-Scale Multimedia \u2022 11-776: Multimodal Affective Computing \u2022 11-777: Multimodal Machine Learning \u2022 11-785: Deep Learning \u2022 11-797: Question Answering Students may request to have other LTI course s with a group engineering project component to be added to this list. For definitions of quoted terms, see the section on \u201cDefinitions of LTI Terminology .\u201d Unless approved by the Program Director in advance, t he course requirements must be satisfied by actual classroom courses, not credit given for research or independent study", "MLT Graduate Student Handbook Page 14 Note that a Masters \u2019 Thesis is not required in general, although a thesis project may be used to satisfy the \u201clab\u201d requirement. 4.1.1 Grade Requirements Students must demonstrate their mastery of material taught in courses and their success in applying their skills in directed study by satisfying the following grade requirements: 1. Minimum grade: Only courses with a grade of C (2.0) or higher are counted as satisfying a degree requirement. 2. Pass/fail: Pass/fail grades are not permitted for courses and projects used to satisfy a degr ee requirement. 4.1.2 Research Speaking Requirement To emphasize student research, improve public speaking skills , and increase internal awareness of LTI work, all MLT students must complete an oral presentation in their second year (by the end of May). The presentation should consist of a 20-minute talk plus time for discussion. It must be advertised to the LTI mailing lists at least one week before your presentation, and the public will be invited. At least two CMU faculty members will attend the presentation, including the research advisor. After the presentation, these faculty members will convene and provide written feedback to both the student and the chair of graduate programs (the form for this is available on the LTI website). This feedback will help the student refine speaking skills with respect to talk structure, content, and delivery. 4.1.3 Withdrawal of a Degree The University reserves the right to withdraw a degree even though it has been granted should there be discovery that the work upon which it was based or the academic records in support of it had been falsified. In such a case, withdrawal of the degree will occur promptly upon discovery of the falsification. The complete reference to this University policy is available at https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/withdrawal-of-a-degree.html . 4.2 Advising Each student has a faculty advisor charged with guiding the education and monitoring the progress of the student through the program. The advisor also supervises the student's directed study projects. This personal student-advisor relationship ensures that every student receives the necessary faculty mentoring. The advisor also provides the student with career advice", "MLT Graduate Student Handbook Page 15 How and when the advisor is selected: the Marriage Process: Advisors are selected during the first month of the program. Students are expected to attend the LTI's Orientation (\u201cImmigration Course ,\u201d or IC) lectures, in which faculty describe their interests and areas of expertise, and to be proactive about meeting individually with potential advisors. After meeting with several potential advisors, each student will be asked to indicate a firs t, second, and third choice for advisor. Meanwhile, the potential advisors determine how many new students they can take, and indicate their preferences. Finally, the entire LTI faculty meets as a \u201c Marriage Committee \u201d to determine the best set of matches. Some entering MLT students are prefunded, meaning they have received and accepted a funding letter from a faculty member before the Marriage Process. (Even students who are prefunded must attend the research talks, to become acquainted with the LTI\u2019s rese arch projects.) Even self-supporting MLT students are expected to perform research with a faculty advisor, since research experience is an important part of our graduate programs. Until a student finds a specific advisor, the chair of the LTI graduate prog rams serves as the advisor. How to change advisors: The initial advisor selection should be made carefully. However, it is possible to change advisors. To do so, the student should find another faculty member willing to serve as an advisor, and then make a request to the Program Director to switch advisors. The LTI follows the long-standing SCS policy that both the new and old advisors need to agree to the change; typically, this is not a problem ( assuming the new advisor has agreed in advance, as described here ). It is to the student's advantage to avoid switching advisors, especially late in their graduate studies, because forging a strong student-advisor relationship takes time. 4.3 Optional Masters\u2019 Thesis MLT students may optionally elect to complete a Mast ers\u2019 Thesis; it is not required. Students who intend to apply for the PhD program should consider the MLT Thesis as one of several ways to demonstrate their research potential. Other possibilities include innovative research in a research project or class project work. The MLT Thesis must be completed according to the following guidelines. Note in particular the October 31 proposal deadline! \u2022 There are two course components required for students who elect to complete the M.S. Thesis: 11-928 \u2013 Masters \u2019 Thesis I (with the chosen thesis advisor, typically for 12 units, typically in the Fall of their second year) and 11-929 \u2013 Masters \u2019 Thesis II in the following Spring. \u2022 Each of these two courses counts towards 6 units of MLT-level LTI course credit; if the student goes on to an LTI PhD, the second course (11-929) counts towards one PhD lab requirement. \u2022 The MLT thesis may focus on either a significant research result or a significant implementation of a new technology. The student should work with their adv isor to define an interesting but bounded thesis research project. The MLT thesis culminates in", "MLT Graduate Student Handbook Page 16 a publication-quality paper that clearly describes the work in terms of its research significance. \u2022 The MLT thesis committee will be composed of a thesis advisor and two additional readers, to be chosen by the student in consultation with the advisor, during the Fall Masters \u2019 Thesis I course. At least 2 of the 3 committee members must be SCS faculty working in Language Technologies. \u2022 To receive a final grade for the first semester's course, the student must have prepared a written proposal of at least five pages, describing the scientific thesis to be investigated, any relevant research already completed by the student, a comparison with related work by others, and a detailed description of the work to be done in the next semester. The proposal MUST be accepted by the committee by the end of October , or the student will not be allowed to enroll in 11-929 \u2013 Masters \u2019 Thesis II! \u2022 Sometime d uring the semester when the student enrolls in 11-929 \u2013 Masters \u2019 Thesis II (typically, their final semester), the student will distribute a draft of the thesis to the committee for initial review. This should be done as early as feasible, to avoid last-minute surprises that could delay final approval of the thesis. \u2022 The thesis work culminates in submission of the final version of the thesis document, followed by a public presentation of the work in an LTI seminar (or other suitable public forum). Since the defense is public, the LTI graduate program administrator must receive all the information required for a public announcement at least one week before the defense. The Masters \u2019 Thesis presentation is somewhat less rigorous than a PhD thesis defense. The pre sentation must communicate the research work done, similar to a conference paper presentation. The committee will observe the presentation, and then decide whether the thesis and presentation were acceptable, or whether further work is required. Unlike a P hD defense, only a simple majority vote of the committee is required for approval. \u2022 Although students are required to enroll in the appropriate course sequence of two Masters \u2019 Thesis courses, it is not required that students finish the thesis by the end of that second semester. If a student requires more time to revise the thesis to the committee's satisfaction, and adequately present the work, an incomplete grade will be assessed in the Masters \u2019 Thesis course, until such time as the work and presentation ar e accepted. The student will still be allowed to walk in Spring Commencement, if all other requirements for the MLT degree have been completed. Students should note that any financial support beyond the end of the semester will be on a case-by-case basis, and must be arranged in advance with the project supporting them. Students are strongly encouraged to finish the thesis work within one (1) year following the semester they enroll for the first Masters \u2019 Thesis course", "MLT Graduate Student Handbook Page 17 4.4 Definitions of LTI Terminology We define here some of the terms as used in this handbook: \u2022 An \u201cLTI course\u201d is any 12-unit course with a number of 11-XXX; a 6-unit course with an 11-XXX counts as 1/2 of an LTI course. Unless otherwise specified, \"course\" means an actual classroom course, not credit given for research or independent study. Note that we will allow any one MLD (10-xxx) graduate-level course to count as an \u201cLTI course.\u201d \u2022 An \u201cSCS course\u201d is any 12-unit course with a course number indicating a unit of the School of Computer Science (including LTI); a 6-unit course with such a number counts as 1/2 of an SCS course. Unless otherwise specified, \"course\" means an actual classroom course, not credit given for research or independent study. Note: Recommended electives that are technically outside of the SCS now count towards this requirement; for example, Dig ital Signal Processing in ECE. Please see the Program Director for approval of electives as \u201cSCS .\u201d \u2022 \u201cLTI Focus Areas\u201d are sets of courses defined on the LTI course webpage under \u201cCourse Categories .\u201d If a student believes a new course should be added to a Focus Area, they should notify the Chair of the LTI Graduate Programs. He will decide, with advice from faculty in the appropriate area, whether it should be in the Focus Area, and if approved it will be added to the LTI Focus Area webpage. o A \u201cTask-Orientation Focus Course\u201d is simply a course belonging to that LTI Focus Area, as listed on the \u201cCourse Categories\u201d webpage. \u2022 An LTI \u201clab course\u201d is simply a course in the list of lab courses def ined in the LTI \u201cCourse Categories\u201d webpage. 4.5 Recommended Electives outside of SCS Students are free to take elective courses outside the SCS, at Carnegie Mellon or cross-registered at the University of Pittsburgh, as long as the student fulfills the requi rements of their program as described above. The student should discuss any such electives in advance with their advisor; typical choices might include ECE courses for Speech students, Pitt Linguistics courses, or Statistics courses. Note: recommended electives outside of the SCS count towards the \u201cSCS\u201d course requirement. Please see the Program Director for approval of electives as \u201cSCS. \u201d Note also that students need advance approval for any courses not covered by their normal tuition (e.g., summer courses ). The grading of outside courses is the responsibility of the department offering the course; however , the LTI's Minimum Course Grade Policy described above still applies (\u201c B-\u201d is the minimu m for PhD, \u201c C\u201d for MLT)", "MLT Graduate Student Handbook Page 18 4.6 LTI Orientation At the beginning of each Fall semester, the LTI provides a set of lectures and talks to help students learn about the work done by CMU faculty and to provide an opportunity for advisors to recruit new students. Students are expected to attend them and treat them seriously, because they provide a good introduction to the broad range of research done at the LTI. Students do not register for the LTI Orientation, nor do they receive a grade; however , the department is serious about its expectation that new students will attend these talks. For many years, these talks were called \"the Immigration Course (IC)\" , which caused confusion. The older name has been retired; however , people who have been at CMU a long time may occasionally use the older name. 4.7 End of Semester Evaluation Near the end of the spring and fall semester s, the student must prepare a statement that describes their achievements in the current semester, and plans for the next semester. At the end of the semester, the faculty evaluates each student's academic progress. The student's advisor serves as the student's advocate in this process. The result of the evaluation is a letter from the faculty to the student that indicates whether the student is making satisfactory progress towards completing the degre e. A good letter typically indicates that the student is making satisfactory progress. If the student is doing exceptionally good work, a stronger adjective such as excellent might be used, but this is unusual. If a student seems to be having trouble, the faculty determines whether it believes that the student can finish the degree, and if so, what needs to be accomplished to get back on track. This type of letter should be considered a serious warning. It is not a permanent \u201cblack mark\u201d on the student's record; if the student begins making satisfactory progress again, there is no official record of the letter in the student's transcript. In the most serious cases, the faculty gives the student an N-1 letter that specifies a list of conditions that the student must satisfy by specific deadlines. Failure to meet all of the specified conditions may result in the student's termination from the program. 4.8 Enrollment Verification Enrollment Services is the only University office that can provide an official letter of enrollment, official transcript and enrollment verification. Enrollment verification can be requested online through The HUB at: http://www.cmu.edu/hub/transcripts/verifications/enrollment.html ", "MLT Graduate Student Handbook Page 19 4.9 University Policies on Grades and Grading 4.9.1 University Policy on Grades ww.cmu.edu/policies/documents/Grades.html This policy offers details concerning university grading principles for students taking courses and covers the speci fics of assigning and changing grades, grading options, drop/withdrawals, and course repeats. It also defines the undergraduate and graduate grading standards. 4.9.2 University Policy on Grades for Transfer Courses www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/TransferCredit.html Carnegie Mellon University offers students the opportunity to take courses for credit through a cross-registration program (see Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE) and Cross-registration below) and through the receipt of transfer credit from other accredited institutions. The Carnegie Mellon University transcript will include information on such courses as follows: Carnegie Mellon cours es and courses taken through the university's cross-registration program will have grades recorded on the transcript and be factored into the QPA. All other courses will be recorded on this transcript indicating where the course was taken, but without grade. Such courses will not be taken into account for academic actions, honors , or QPA calculations. (Note: Suspended students may take courses elsewhere; however, they may receive transfer credit only if their college\u2019s and department's policies allow this.) 4.10 Academic Integrity Please review the University Policy on Academic Integrity: https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html The policy includes the University expectations around academic integrity and provides definitions of cheating, plagiarism, and unauthorized assistance. A review of the University\u2019s Academic Disciplinary Actions procedures is also recommended. These procedures outline the process for investigating, reporting, and adjudicating violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity. The procedures also outline the appeals process. https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html In the midst of self-exploration, the high demands o f a challenging academic environment can create situations where some students have difficulty exercising good judgment. Academic challenges can provide many opportunities for high standards to evolve if students actively reflect on these challenges and if the community supports discussions to aid in this process. It is the responsibility of the entire community to establish and maintain the integrity of our university", "MLT Graduate Student Handbook Page 20 Carnegie Mellon University educates its students to become professionals who will serve society with integrity. The university also creates and disseminates new knowledge and expressions of knowledge in ways that benefit society. Carnegie Mellon strives to serve the changing needs of society through the three primary goals outlined in its mission statement: to create and disseminate knowledge and art through research and artistic expression, teaching and learning and transfer to society; to serve students by teaching them leadership, problem-solving skills, and the values of quality, ethical behavior, responsibility to society and commitments to work; and to pursue the advantages provided by a diverse community, open to the exchange of ideas, where discovery and artistic creativity can flourish. In any presentation, creative, artistic or resear ch, it is the ethical responsibility of each student to identify the conceptual sources of the work submitted. Failure to do so is dishonest and is the basis for a charge of cheating or plagiarism, which is subject to disciplinary action. The university has a very clear and specific protocol for responding to alleged violations of academic integrity. Carnegie Mellon's Academic Disciplinary Actions Overview for Graduate Students describes procedures for disciplinary actions against graduate students in case s of alleged violations of academic regulations and the appeal process. Please see https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/academic-discipline/ for more information. Important note: The LTI implements the above policy\u2019s option of \u201cconven[ing] a disciplinary hearing according to the procedures of the department/program.\u201d Our procedure is as follows: a first violation is grounds for dismiss al from the graduate program. If we decide not to immediately dismiss, the first violation will result in the student being on disciplinary probation. If a student commits a second violation while on probation, the penalty is dismissal from the graduate pr ogram. 5 Academic Policies 5.1 MLT Academic Policies 5.1.1 Duration of Study MLT students enrolled for full-time study are expected to complete the degree in two calendar years (24 months). This includes two summers of full-time directed research. See also the \u201c Statute of Lim itations\u201d policy. 5.1.2 Double-Dipping A Masters student who uses courses taken as part of another degree program (at Carnegie Mellon or elsewhere) toward their program requirements cannot use those same courses", "MLT Graduate Student Handbook Page 21 toward any other M.S. degree offered by the School of Computer Science without prior approval. This is an SCS-wide policy. 5.1.3 Pass/Fail Grades Pass/fail grades are not permitted for courses used to satisfy a degree requirement. Graduate students who are required to take additional undergraduate courses to build up the core foundations of computer science may not elect the pass/fail option for these courses. 5.1.4 Independent Study For an Independent Study to satisfy a n MLT student\u2019s coursework requirements, it must be approved by the MLT Program Director in advance . In consultation with the CMU faculty member who will be supervising the Independent Study, the student should produce a short (half-page to one page) description of the goals of the Independent Study, and how the results will be evaluated, and submit it to the Program Director before the end of the Add period of the semester of the proposed study. The study should be planned so that it is finished in time for the supervising faculty member to give a grade at the end of the semester. Independent studies may be undertaken for 6 or 12 units. Normally only one Independent Study would be approved during a student\u2019s MLT coursework. 5.1.5 Transfer Credit An equivalent graduate course previously completed at another institution may be permitted to satisfy one of the MLT course requirements. The decision on whether a course may be transferred is made by the MLT Program Director. Typically , the student will provide the Program Director with the syllabus of the external course, and the Program Director will use that and the student\u2019s transcript to make the decision. See the section on \u201cDefinition of transfer credit versus course exemption .\u201d All MLT students are required to take a minimum of 96 units of coursework at CMU. 5.1.6 External Internships MLT students may only engage in internships if their advisors recommend it, since the program is 24 months, including summers. International students are required to consult with the Office of International Education for eligibility before seeking an internship/co-op or signing a n offer contract. We caution all students to be aware of potential intellectual property (IP) problems with internships, and to review any IP agreements with their advisors before signing them. It is possible to lose ownership of your ideas. Important: See also section 4.2.3, External Employment/Consulting", "MLT Graduate Student Handbook Page 22 5.1.7 Transferring Into the MLT Program Transfers into the MLT program are not permitted during a student\u2019s first semester at CMU. Students must begin their study at CMU in the program that admitted them; this is a university policy. Students may request to transfer into the MLT program after completing their first semester. The student must make the request in writing (or email) to the MLT/PhD Admissions Chair. The MLT/PhD Admissions Chair will inform the student about what application materials are required; for example, an explanation of why a transfer is desired, a proposed plan of study, a proposed advisor, and CMU transcripts. Students that are already enrolled in an LTI degree program are not required to retake GRE and TOEFL exams or to produce new transcripts from other universities. The MLT program will conduct an expedited admissions process after receiving such a request. 5.1.8 Transferring Out of the MLT Program The MLT program does not prevent students from transferring to another degree program. Each degree program has its own rules about whether and when transfers into the program are permitted. A student that is interested in transferring out of the MLT degree program should consult the handbook and Pr ogram Director of the desired degree program to learn whether transfers are permitted, and if so, how and when to request such a transfer. 5.1.9 Drop/Add/Withdraw Procedures Students taking undergraduate and Masters\u2019 level courses must follow the procedures and deadlines for adding, dropping, and withdrawing from courses as identified on the academic calendar. Information can be found at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/course-changes.index . Please note that there is a separate calendar for doctoral courses that does not apply to Masters\u2019 students. 5.1.10 Statute of Limitations As outlined in the Master\u2019s Students Statute of Limitations, https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of-limitations.html. Students will complete all requirements for the m a sters\u2019 degree within a maximum of seven years from original matriculation as a masters\u2019 student, or less if required by a more restrictive department, school, or college policy. Once this time-to-degree limit has lapsed, the person may resume work towards a masters\u2019 degree only if newly admitted to a currently offered master s\u2019 degree program under criteria determined by that program. See also the \u2018Duration of Study\u2019 policy", "MLT Graduate Student Handbook Page 23 5.1.11 Teaching Requirements MLT students do not normally serve as Teaching Assistants (TAs). If an MLT student wants to TA a course, they must get the approval of their research advisor. In the unusual case of an MLT student TAing, note that graduate students are required to have a certain level of fluency in English before they can instruct in Pennsylvania, as required by the English Fluency in Higher Education Act of 1990. Through this Act, all institutions of higher education in the state are required to evaluate and certify the English fluency of all instructional personnel, including teaching assistants and interns. The full University policy can be reviewed at https://www.cmu.edu/policies/faculty/evaluation-certification-english-fluency-instructors.html . The fluency of all instructional personnel will be rated by Language Support in the S tudent Academic Success Center to determine at what level of responsibility the student can TA. In addition to administering the International Teaching Assistant (ITA) Test (a mandatory screening for all non-native speakers of English), Language Support in the Student Academic Success Center helps teaching assistants who are non-native English speakers develop fluency and cultural understanding to teach successfully at Carnegie Mellon. Visit the Student Academic Success Center website for additional information: https://www.cmu.edu/student-success/ . 5.2 LTI Academic Policies 5.2.1 \u201cGrandfather\u201d policy A student can graduate under the policies in effect at the time that the student entered the program; or, at the student's choice, the student can graduate under policies that are adopted after the student entered the program. If it is not realistic to follow a particular policy exactly, the department may approximate the policy as closely as possible; this situation is rare and typically arises only when a student is enrolled in the program for an extended period of time. 5.2.2 Definition of transfer credit versus course exemption The LTI may grant transfer credit or issue an exemption for equivalent graduate courses previously completed at another institution. This decision rests with the chair of the particular program. If a student is exempt from a required course due to prior courses or experience, the student can replace that course with an open elective. The student does not receive credit for the external course, but can take any course that could normally count toward the degree in its place. If a student receives c redit for prior coursework completed at CMU or elsewhere, the student receives that many units of credit, and the total amount of required coursework is reduced by that amount", "MLT Graduate Student Handbook Page 24 5.2.3 External Employment/Consulting Students funded by LTI research projects are nor mally expected to work exclusively for those projects. Since consulting may provide useful experience, students are generally permitted to consult, at most , one eight-hour day per seven-day week, only with the advisor's consent. International students must also have approval in advance from the Office of International Education (OIE); otherwise, they may be in violation of their visa status. Important: Any work for pay outside of the funding research project must be approved in advance by the advisor (and OIE, for international students). This includes paid TAing, consulting, online free-lancing, etc. 5.2.4 Leave of Absence The LTI discourages Leaves of Absence (LOA), since students usually do not return, despite good intentions. However, a student in good standing may be granted a LOA of at most 1 year, upon written request to the Program Director and with consent of the student's advisor. It is the responsibility of the student on LOA to contact the LTI to initiate a return to the program. 5.2.5 Satisfactory Progress If a student does not make satisfactory progress each semester toward completing the degree, the LTI may remove the student from the program. See section on \u201cEnd of Semester Evaluation .\u201d 5.2.6 Winter and Summer Breaks Students supported by research projects are expected to remain on campus working during breaks in classes. A two-week vacation is ty pically allowed in the summer. The normal winter break policy is that the student works 40 hours per week for two weeks, and takes vacation for the other two weeks. 5.3 CMU Academic Policies 5.3.1 Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities http://www.cmu.edu/disability-resources The Office of Disability Resources at Carnegie Mellon University has a continued mission to provide physical and programmatic campus access to all events and information within the Carnegie Mellon community. We work to ensure that qualified individuals rec eive reasonable accommodations as guaranteed by the Americans with Disabilitie s Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Students who would like to receive accommodations can begin", "MLT Graduate Student Handbook Page 25 the process through Disability Resources\u2019 secure online portal or email access@andrew.cmu.edu to begin the interactive accommodation proce ss. Students with physical, sensory, cognitive, or emotional disabilities are encouraged to self-identify with the Office of Disability Resources and request needed accommodations. Any questions about the process can be directed to access@andrew.cmu.edu or call 412-268-6121. 5.3.2 Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures https://www.cmu.edu/graduate/policies/appeal-grievance-procedures.html Graduate students will find the Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures on the Graduate Education Resource webpage. This document summarizes processes available to graduate students who seek review of academic and non-academic issues. Generally, graduate students are expected to seek informal resolution of all concerns within the applicable department, unit, or program before invoking formal p rocesses. When an informal resolution cannot be reached, however, a graduate student who seeks further review of the matter is to follow the for mal procedures outlined here. T hese appeal and grievance procedures shall apply to students in all graduate programs of the University. Students should refer to the department specific information in this handbook for department and college information about the administration and aca demic policies of the program. 5.3.3 Process for Appealing Final Grades https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/academic/appeal-of-grades-and academic-actions.html Final grades will be changed only in exceptional circumstances and only with the approval of the instructor and the department, unit, or program. Grading is a matter of sound discretion of the instructor, and final grades are rarely changed without the consent of the instructor who assigned the grade. The following circumstances are the unusual exceptions that may warrant a grade appeal: a) The final grade assigned for a course is based on manifest error (e.g., a clear error such as arithmetic error in computing a grade or failure to grade one of the answers on an exam) b) The faculty or staff member who assigned the grade did so in violation of University policy", "MLT Graduate Student Handbook Page 26 5.3.4 Safeguarding Educational Equity: Sexual Misconduct Policy The University prohibits sex-based discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating/ domestic violence, and stalking. The University also prohibits retaliation against individuals who bring forward such concerns or allegations in good faith. The University\u2019s Sexual Misconduct Policy is available at https://www.cmu.edu/policies/administrative-and-governance/sexual-misconduct/index.html . The University\u2019s Policy Against Retaliation is available at https://www.cmu.edu/policies/administrative-and-governance/whistleblower.html . If you have been impacted by any of these issues, you are encouraged to make contact with any of the following resources: \u2022 Offic e of Title IX Initiatives, https://www.cmu.edu/title-ix/ 412-268-7125, tix@cmu.edu \u2022 University Police, 412-268-2323 Additional resources and information can be found at: https://www.cmu.edu/title-ix/resources-and-information/resources.html . 5.3.5 Gestational and Parental Accommodatio n https://www.cmu.edu/graduate/programs-services/maternity-accommodation protocol.html Providing holistic student support is a top priority at Carnegie Mellon. The protocols on this page are designed to support the parental needs of students and their families. Students seeking any of the parental accommodations described below must register with the Office of the Dean of Students by contacting the office for an appointment by calling 412-268-2075. Students are encouraged to register with the Office of the Dean of Students ninety (90) days in advance of the anticipated arrival of the child as applicable in the individual circumstances. At the time of registration, students will have the opportunity to consult about resources, procedures, funding options, and preparation for discussing academic accommodations with the student\u2019s academic department. Students should also consult with their academic advisors either before or in conjunction with registering with the Office of the Dean of Students. Accommodations for Gestational Parents The birth of a child is a significant life event that may require time away from academic pursuits for delivery and reco very from delivery of a newly born child. Students whose anticipated delivery date is during the course of a semester may need to take time away from their academic responsibilities. Carnegie Mellon students seeking time away are afforded two options as a possible accommodation:", "MLT Graduate Student Handbook Page 27 \u2022 Short-term accommodation for gestational parents \u2013 A short-term absence from academic responsibilities up to a maximum of six (6) weeks. Short term accommodations may be extended by two (2) weeks for a total of eight (8) weeks, wher e a longer absence is medically necessary. Prior to the absence students must work with relevant university faculty and staff to adjust their course work, research, teaching and other academic responsibilities during the period of absence. This may include extensions of time to complete assignments, incomplete grades, and/or dropping courses, shifting research responsibilities and adjusting TA assignments. Students who take a short-t erm ac commodation will remain enrolled. \u2022 Formal Leave of Absence-A formal leave of absence under the Student Leave Policy. Generally, the Student Leave Policy permits students to take a leave of absence for a full-semester, mini-semester, or for the time remaining in the semester during which the leave is taken. Students who take a Formal Leave of Absence ( https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/student-leave.html) drop all remaining courses for the semester and are unenrolled for the semester. International students must consult with the Office of International Education (https://www.cmu.edu/oie/) before considering this option due to visa implications. Financial Assistance for Student Parents Carnegie Mellon also offers the following options for financial assistance to students who become parents while enrolled: Interest-free Loan \u2013 Any student who becomes a parent is eligible to apply for an interest-free parental loan ( https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/dean/loans/ ) from the Office of the Dean of Students. 6 Financial Issues 6.1 Graduate Student Funding For all LTI MLT students, full funding (tuition plus stipend) is guaranteed for the first year. This support is normally continued for the duration of the program, subject to continuing satisfactory progress and availability of funding. The fellowship includes full tuition and fees, and a monthly MLT stipend. In addition, the LTI pays a dependency allowance of 10% of the student's monthly stipend to any student with a child, unless they have a spouse who earns more than $200 per month. If an MLT student receives an outside graduate fellowship (e.g., NSF, Fulbright), the student is expected to accept it in place of the LTI\u2019s graduate fellowship. As an extra incentive to do so, the LTI will supplement the award so that the student will receive full tuition and a combined", "MLT Graduate Student Handbook Page 28 stipend 10 percent higher than that of the standard LTI graduate fellowship. Students are required to inform the LTI about any external funding that they receive. 6.2 University Financial Aid Graduate students should consult the graduate student financial aid information found on The HUB website: http://www.cmu.edu/finaid/graduate/index.html . 6.3 Conference Travel Funding Students funded by a research project receive travel funding according to policies set by the individual projects. Students who have no project funding may be provided with partial funding, with a larger amount available for travel to presen t a refereed conference paper. There is an LTI form that must be filled out in advance. 6.4 Office of the Dean of Students Emergency Support Funding Graduate students who find themselves in need of immediate funds for emergency situations should contact the Office of the Dean of Students (see Appendix A), www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/index.html , to inquire about the types of emergency funding available to enrolled students. 6.5 Health Insurance Carnegie Mellon has a Student Health Insurance pol icy requiring full-time, degree-seeking students to carry adequate medical insurance. Students must either purchase the plan offered by the University , or an application for a waiver can be made if the student is \u201cenrolled as the dependent, partner/spouse or pr incipal in an employer or government-sponsored insurance plan\u201d (see the Carnegie Mellon University Student Health Insurance Policy at http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/StudentInsurance ). The LTI does not cover student health insurance, regardless of the students\u2019 funding situation. It is the responsibility of each student to make arrangements with Student Health Services to either pay for their insurance at the beginning of the semester, or elect a payment plan over the course of the academic year. Mor e information is available at the Student Health Services Web site www.studentaffairs.cmu.edu/HealthServices/insurance ", "MLT Graduate Student Handbook Page 29 6.6 Emergency Loans http://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/index.html All students , regardless of their program, are eligible for the Emergency Student Loan, which is an interest-free and emergency-based loan repayable within 30 days. It is available through the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs; students may apply for the loan by stopping in to the Student Affairs Office, Warner Hall 301, or by calling (412) 268-2075 for an appointment. 6.7 Employment Eligibility Verification If you are receiving a stipend, are a TA, or are planning to have a positio n with CMU then Employment Eligibility Verification is required. Form I-9 must be completed within 3 business days of beginning work for any type of compensation (stipend or employment). Additional details are highlighted below. To ensure compliance with federal law, Carnegie Mellon University maintains the Employment Eligibility Verification (I-9) Policy [pdf] covering the university\u2019s I-9 and E-Verify requirements: \u2022 Every individual receiving a stipend from CMU or employed by CMU must comply with the I-9 Policy by completing the Form I-9 within three business days following the first day of stipend start date/employment. \u2022 Individuals who expect to work on a federally funded project are further responsible for submitting an E-Verify Processin g Request Form to the Office of Human Resources if required. \u2022 For more information, please see CMU\u2019s Guidance for Completing the Form I-9 and E-Verify Requirements at CMU [pdf], or visit the Human Resources Service website to learn more about Form I-9 and E-Verify and to schedule an appointment to complete the Form I-9. \u2022 Students who fail to complete the Form I-9 in a timely manner may have stipend payments suspended. If employed by the university, an individual who fails to timely complete the Form I-9 may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment. 7 Additional University Resources 7.1 The HUB Student Services Center thehub@andrew.cmu.edu and http://www.cmu.edu/hub/ The HUB is located in Warner Hall, Lower Level. The HUB staff delivers comprehensive service and counsel to students and families regarding financial aid, billing and payment, registration and academic records. The Assistant Directors in The HUB serve as contacts for specific colleges", "MLT Graduate Student Handbook Page 30 and assist enrolled students with key aspects of the enrollment process. Students can find their assigned HUB Assistant Director on their Student Information Online (SIO) Resource page. Questions that need specialized, in-depth attention can be directed to the student' s assigned Assistant Director. For general questions and information, students may email The HUB or call 412-268-8186. 7.2 Student Information Online (SIO) Student Information Online (SIO) is a secure site where students can find important, personalized information, including E-Bills and student account information, financial aid s tatus and eligibility, grades and QPA, and course schedules. Students can update their contact information (and that of their spouse or partner); sign up for E-Check & E-Refund; authorize their spouses, domestic partners or other individual s to receive a copy of their E-Bill; request verifications; view their ho using and meal plan assignments; and much more. Students can log on to SIO by going to www.cmu.edu/hub/sio and entering their Andrew User ID and password. On SIO, students will designate an emergency contact address of a relative or family friend to be contacted in the case of an emergency. If students do not want their name and address publ ished in the campus directory, they must notify the HUB in writing. 7.3 ID Cards Graduate students can obtain their ID card from their program manager, department, or college . These cards identify their holders as members of the campus community. Student cards are deactivated upon the cardholder\u2019s separation from the university. Affiliate ID Cards are available for spouses and partners of graduate students , which allow them to ac cess Carnegie Mellon\u2019s campus. These cards are available through The HUB to spouse s and partners of graduate students who are enrolled for the current academic year in a full-time graduate degree program. Th e card is valid for one year. For information about domestic partner registration, visit the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs webpage: http://www.studentaffairs.cmu.edu/dean/domestic_partner/ . For more information about student and affiliate ID cards (spouse, domestic partners and dependent children), please visit: http://www.cmu.edu/idplus/idcards/cardtypes.html . 7.4 Transcripts Information about and instructions for ordering transcripts are available at: www.cmu.edu/hub/transcripts.html . Transcript questions may be directed to esg-", "MLT Graduate Student Handbook Page 31 transcripts@andrew.cmu.edu . 7.5 Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE) and Cross-registration http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/CrossRegister.html Cross-registration provides an opportunity for enriched educational programs by permitting full-time graduate students to cross-register for courses (usually no more than one per semester) at a Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE) Institution.

These standards require personal integrity, a commitment to honesty without compromise, as well as truth without equivocation and a willingness to place the good of the community above the good of the self. Obligations once undertaken must be met, commitments kept. As members of the Carnegie Mellon community, individuals are expected to uphold the standards of the community in addition to holding others accountable for said standards. It is rare that the life of a student in an academic community can be so private that it will not affect the community as a whole or that the above standards do not apply. The discovery, advancement and communication of knowledge are not possible without a commitment to these standards. Creativity cannot exist without acknowledgment of the creativity of others. New knowledge cannot be developed without credit for prior knowl edge. Without the ability to trust that these principles will be observed, an academic community cannot exist. The commitment of its faculty, staff and students to these standards contributes to the high respect in which the Carnegie Mellon degree is held. Students must not destroy that respect by their failure to meet these standards. Students who cannot meet them should voluntarily withdraw from the university. The Carnegie Mellon Code can also be found on-line at https://www.cmu. edu /student-affairs/theword/. 1.7 University Policies and Expectations It is the responsibility of each member of the Carnegie Mellon community to be familiar with university policies and guidelines.

The LTI cluster provides storage and computation for projects involving large datas ets and/or lengthy computation. 3 CMU Degree Completion and Certification 3.1 Standard Degree Requirements & Degree Certification Carnegie Mellon graduate students are expected to complete their degree requirements within the standard length of time for their program of study as outlined in the relevant Graduate Student Handbook. Standard program lengths for graduate students vary significantly ranging from two semesters for some full-time master\u2019s programs to several or more years for doctoral programs. Upon completion of the graduate program degree requirements, the degree will be certified by the student\u2019s academic program in the s emester in which the student completes the requirements. Early Completion Graduate students who consider the completion of all degree requirements in less than the standard length of time for their program of study may consult with their degree-granting program or department to determine if early degree certification is allowed and under what circumstances . Extended or Longer-than-Standard Comp letion Longer-than-standard degree completion may occur due to academic interruptions in making progress toward the degree as defined by the academic program, interruptions of full-time study or progress towards the degree due to serious, documented medical issues, or other unusual or unforeseen circumstances. Master\u2019s students who require longer than the standard time to complete their degree requirements are expected to remain in close contact with their graduate program, and will be certified at the end of the semester in which they have completed their degree requirements. Students shall reference CMU Policy on Master\u2019s Student Statute of Limitations : www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of limitations.html regarding guidelines and restrictions which place an upper limit on t he maximum length of time allowable for master\u2019s degree completion and certification", "MIIS Graduate Student Handbook Page 12 3.2 Statute of Limitations As outlined in the Master\u2019s Students Statute of Limitations, https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of-limitations.html students will complete all requirements for the master\u2019s degree within a maximum of seven years from original matriculation as a master\u2019s student, or less if required by a more restrictive department, school or college policy. Once this time-to-degree lim it has lapsed, the person may resume work towards a master\u2019s degree only if newly admitted to a currently offered master\u2019s degree program under criteria determined by that program. Under extraordinary circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, family or parental leave, or temporary disability, a school or college may, upon the relevant department's recommendation and with the written approval of the dean (or designate), defer the lapse for a period commensurate with the duration of that interruption. Students who are pursuing a master\u2019s degree as part-time students for all semesters of their program, as approved by their program, may also appeal to their program or department for extension of the time to degree limit. 3.3 Additional Guidance for Students Program of Study Students seeking guidance about their program of study and degree requirements should consult with their academic advisor and/or appropriate associate dean. Financial Aid and Student Account Students are expected to make normal progress toward their degree in order to graduate within the standard timeframe for their program of study. Under U.S. Federal Title IV regulations, student eligibility for federal financial aid is contingent upon enrol lment in and successful completion of courses that are counted as credit toward their current degree program. To receive the maximum amount of federal financial aid for which they may be eligible, students must enroll each semester in at least 36 units that count toward their current degree level. (See separate guidance regarding integrated degree completion.) Students should consult with their designated college liaison in The HUB regarding billing and financial aid, particularly for early completion, long er-than standard completion, or integrated undergraduate and master\u2019s degree programs. International Students Immigration status for students in F-1 and J-1 nonimmigrant status is tied to making normal progress toward completing degree requirements. Therefore, F-1 and J-1 students who are considering completing their degree requirements early, anticipating longer-than-standard completion, or moving from an undergraduate to a graduate student classification (integrated undergraduate-graduate study) should consult with their designated advisor in the Office of International Education (OIE) to ensure compliance with immigration regulations", "MIIS Graduate Student Handbook Page 13 4 MIIS Degree Requirements and Related Policies/Protocols 4.1 Program Options The MIIS degree is offered in two options: Option 1. Standard MIIS degree (MIIS-16)-A 16-month track that is completed in three academic semesters (fall, spring, fall) and a summer internship. Option 2.

Directed study is a structured, task-oriented form of independent study that provides deep, hands-on experience in a particular technology area and an opportunity to work closely with a member of the faculty. 2. Internship requirement: Students must complete a one-semester (typically summer) internship at an organization (typically a company or government agency) approved by the MIIS Program Director. Internships are an opportunity to apply new skills in a professional setting and to le arn about software development in a \u2018real world\u2019 organization. Students with prior professional experience may petition the MIIS Program Director to waive this requirement. MIIS students that do an internship during the summer semester are required to present their internship at a poster session at the beginning of the following Fall semester. The poster and the student\u2019s participation in the poster session are part of the internship requirement. Participation is required unless waived in writing by the MIIS Program Director. 3. Capstone requirements: Students must complete a capstone project (36 units) and a capstone planning seminar (6 units). The capstone requirement gives students experience with collaborative, team-oriented software development; significant hands-on experience with the techniques studied in the classroom; and an opportunity to work on a large software application. a. The capstone project (36 units) is a large, group-oriented demonstration of student skill in one or more areas covered by the degree. Typically, the result of the capstone project is a major software application. The capstone project is supervised by a member of the faculty who meets with students on a weekly basis to monitor progress and provide guidance", "MIIS Graduate Student Handbook Page 17 b. The capstone planning seminar (6 units) organizes students into groups; defines capstone project goals, requirements, success metrics, and deliverables; and identifies and acquires data, software, and other resources required for successful completion of the project. The planning seminar must be completed in the semester prior to taking the capstone project. 4.6 Registration Process/Procedures Students are responsible for registering for their courses. Use the Stellic Degree Audit Application to monitor your progress and plan your degree. Students can search for relevant courses in a number of ways and share your plan with your advisor directly through the application. Navigate to the SIO Academic Info tab and select Enrollment Status and the upcoming semester to confirm the following: \u2022 Enrollment Status is 'Eligible to Enroll' (if not, email thehub@andrew.cmu.edu ) \u2022 Maximum units for which you can plan to register for (overloads are reviewed and permitted only after registration week) \u2022 Class Level, College and Department are correct (if incorrect, please contact your home academic department) The registration process can be completed within SIO (Student Information Online) by following 4 easy steps: https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/docs/4-easy-steps.pdf If students have any questions about course selection, students may reach out to MIIS program director, Teruko Mitamura. 4.7 Drop/Add/Withdraw Procedures Students taking undergraduate and master\u2019s level courses must follow the procedures and deadlines for adding, dropping, or withdrawing from courses as identified on the academic calendar. Information can be found at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/course-changes/index.html . P lease note that there is a separate calendar for doctoral courses that does not apply to Masters\u2019 students. 4.8 Transfer Courses and Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE)", "MIIS Graduate Student Handbook Page 18 Carnegie Mellon University offers students the opportunity to take courses for credit through a cross-registration program (see Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE) and Cross-registration below) and through the receipt of transfer credit from other accredited institutions. The Carnegie Mellon University transcript will include info rmation on such courses as follows: Carnegie Mellon courses and courses taken through the university's cross-registration program will have grades recorded on the transcript and be factored into the QPA. All other courses will be recorded on this transcript indicating where the course was taken, but without grades. Such courses will not be considered for academic actions, honors or QPA calculations. https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/transfer-credit-evaluation-and-assignment.html NOTE: Suspended students may take courses elsewhere; however, they may receive transfer credit only if their college\u2019s and department's policies allow this. 4.9 Internships If the experience will have units attached to it, the program should have deliverables from the student commensurate with the number of units they are taking. This can be in the form of interim and final reports on the experience, presentations in the foll owing semester regarding the experience, assessments of their experience as it relates to their course of study, etc. Students are responsible for identifying and applying for internships on their own. The LTI and the university provide several types of support for students seeking internships. An annual poster session helps spread information from MIIS students that recently completed internships to MIIS students that will soon seek internships; other LTI professional master\u2019s programs have similar internship-oriented poster sessions that MIIS s tudents may attend. The university offers resume-writing and interviewing workshops to help prepare students and fall and spring employment fairs to help students connect with companies. The university\u2019s Career & Professional Development Center https://www.cmu.edu/career/ provides other services as well. If a student cannot find an internship, the MIIS program will arrange an on-campus internship with a university-based project. This internship may be unpaid. International students are required to consult with Office of International Education for eligibility before seeking an internship/co-op or signing an offer contract (required addition to ensure the university is in compliance with immigration laws for F & J status students) . 4.10 Advising", "MIIS Graduate Student Handbook Page 19 Each student has a faculty advisor charged with guiding the education and monitoring the progress of the student through the program. The advisor also supervises the student's directed study projects. This personal student-advisor relationship ensures that every student receives the necessary faculty mentoring. The advisor also provides the student with career advice. How and when the advisor is selected: Advisors are selected during the first month of the program. Students are expected to attend the LTI Orientation Faculty Research Talks in which faculty describe their interests and areas of expertise, and to be proactive about meeting individually with potential advisors. Typically, if a student and faculty member agree to enter an advising relationship, it is approved by the Program Director. If a student has not found an advisor after one month in the program, the Pr ogram Director will assign an advisor to the student. How to change advisors: The initial advisor selection should be made carefully. However, it is possible to change advisors. To do so, the student should find another faculty member willing to serve as an advisor, and then make a request to the Program Director to switch advisors . The LTI follows the long-standing SCS policy that both the new and old advisors need to agree to the change; typically, this is not a problem, assuming the new advisor has agreed in advance, as described here. It is to the student' s advantage to avoid switching advisors, especially late in their graduate studies, because forging a strong student-advisor relationship takes time. 4.11 LTI Orientation Prior to the beginning of each Fall semester the LTI provides lectures and faculty research talks to help students learn about the work done by CMU faculty and to provide an opportunity for advisors to recruit new students. Students are expected to attend them and to treat them as seriously as a course, because they provide a good introduction to the broad range of research done at the LTI. Students do not have to register for the LTI Orientation Faculty Research Talks, nor do they receive a grade, however the department is serious about its expectation that new students will attend these talks. The LTI Orientation Canvas course is a mandatory course designed to increase incoming LTI graduate students' awareness and understanding of CMU's community standards and the resources that CMU offers the students. The course includes several administrative tasks, training, and educational sessions. The students will be enrolled into the course by the program administrator in early August. All MIIS students are expected to complete all assignments by the end of their first semester in the program. Each assignment has its own due date. 4.12 Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures Graduate students will find the Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures on the Graduate Education Resource webpage. This document summarizes", "MIIS Graduate Student Handbook Page 20 processes available to graduate students who seek review of academic and non-academic issues. Generally, graduate students are expected to seek informal resolution of all concerns within the applicable department, unit, or program before invoking formal processes. When an informal resolution cannot be reached, however, a graduate student who seeks further review of the matter is to follow the formal procedures outlined here. These appeal and grievance procedures shall apply to students in all graduate progr ams of the University. Students should refer to the department specific information in this handbook for department and college information about the administration and academic policies of the program. Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures-Office of Graduate and Postdoctoral Affairs-Carnegie Mellon University (cmu.edu) 4.13 Intellectual Property Policy The MIIS degree program adheres to Carnegie Mellon University policy on intellectual property: http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/IntellProp.html 5 Grad ing and Evaluation 5.1 Grading Scale/System Students must demonstrate their mastery of material taught in courses and their success in applying their skills in directed study and capstone projects by satisfying the following grade requirements: 1. Minimum grade: A student must obtain a B-or better grade in all courses, which count towards core requirements. If a student receives a C or better, that course may count as an elective towards the degree requirements . 2. Minimum QPA : A student must maintain an average QPA of at least 3.0 in courses and projects used to satisfy degree requirements. 3. Pass/fail: Pass/fail grades are not permitted for courses and projects used to satisfy a degree requirement. Graduate students who are required to take additional undergraduate courses to build up the core foundations of computer science may not elect the pass/fail option for these courses. 5.2 Pass/Fail Grades Pass/fail grades are not permitted for courses used to satisfy a degree requirement, except for the 11-696 (A) Capstone Planning Seminar and 11-935 (R) LTI Practicum that are a Pass/Fail", "MIIS Graduate Student Handbook Page 21 Graduate students who are required to take additional undergraduate courses to build up the core foundations of computer science may not elect the pass/fail option for these courses. 5.3 Independent Study An independent study can be counted as an Elective course, but it cannot be counted as a Qualifying course. 5.4 University Policy on Grades This policy offers details concerning university grading principles for students taking courses and covers the specifics of assigning and changing grades, grading options, drop/withdrawals, and course repeats. It also defines the undergraduate and graduat e grading standards. https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/grading.html 5.5 Process for Appealing Final Grades Final grades will be changed only in exceptional circumstances and only with the approval of the instructor and the department, unit or program. Grading is a matter of sound discretion of the instructor and final grades are rarely changed without the consent of the instructor who assigned the grade. The following circumstances are the unusual exceptions that may warrant a grade appeal: (a) the final grade assigned for a course is based on manifest error ( e.g., a clear error such as arithmetic error in computing a grade or failure to grade one of the answers on an exam), or (b) the faculty or staff member who assigned the grade did so in violation of a university policy. Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures-Office of Graduate and Postdoctoral Affairs-Carnegie Mellon University (cmu.edu) 5.6 Policy on Grades for Transfer Courses Carnegie Mellon University offers students the opportunity to take courses for credit through a cross-registration program (see Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE) and Cross-registration below) and through the receipt of transfer credit from other accredited institutions. The Carnegie Mellon University transcript will include information on such courses as follows: Carnegie Mellon courses and courses taken through the university's cross-registration program will have grades recorded on the transcript and be factored into the QPA. All other courses will be recorded on this transcript indicating where the course was taken, but without grade. Such courses will not be taken into account for academic actions, honors or", "MIIS Graduate Student Handbook Page 22 QPA calculations. (Note: Suspended students may take courses elsewhere; however, they may receive transfer credit only if their college\u2019s and department's policies allow this.) https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/transfer-credit-evaluation-and-assignment.html 5.7 End of Semester Evaluation Near the end of each semester, the student must prepare a statement that describes their achievements in the current semester and plans for the next semester. At the end of the semester, the faculty evaluates each student's academic progress. The student's advisor serves as the student's advocate in this process. The result of the evaluation is a letter from the faculty to the student that indicates whether the student is making satisfactory progress towards completing the degree. A good letter typically indicates that the student is making satisfactory progress. If the student is doing exceptionally good work, a stronger adjective such as excellent might be used, but this is unusual. If a student seems to be having trouble, the faculty determines whether it believes that the student can finish the degree, and if so, what needs to be accomplished to get back on track. This type of letter should be considered a serious warning. It is not a permanent \"black mark\" on the student's record; if the student begins making satisfactory progress again, there is no official record of the letter in the student's transcript. In the most serious cases, the faculty gives the student an N-1 letter that specifies a list of conditions that the student must satisfy by specific deadlines. Failure to meet all the specified conditions may result in the student's termination from the program. 5.8 Satisfactory Progress If a student does not make satisfactory progress each semester toward completing the degree, the LTI may remove the student from the program or strongly encourage the student to consider switching to the four-semester program (MIIS-21) to complete all the requirements. 5.9 Academic Integrity Please review the University Policy on Academic Integrity https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html. The policy includes the University expectations around academic integrity and provides definitions of cheating, plagiarism, and unauthorized assistance", "MIIS Graduate Student Handbook Page 23 A review of the University\u2019s Academic Disciplinary Actions procedures https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/academic-discipline/index.html is also recommended. These procedures outline the process for investigating, reporting, and adjudicating violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity. The procedures also outline the appeal process. In the midst of self-exploration, the high demands of a challenging academic environment can create situations where some students have difficulty exercising good judgment. Academic challenges can provide many opportunities for high standards to evolve if students actively reflect on these challenges and if the community supports discussions to aid in this process. It is the responsibility of the entire community to establish and maintain the integrity of our university. Carnegie Mellon University educates its students to become professionals who will serve society with integrity. The university also creates and disseminates new knowledge and expressions of knowledge in ways that benefit society. Carnegie Mellon strives to serve the changing needs of society through the three primary goals outlined in its mission statement: to create and disseminate knowledge and art through research and artistic expression, teaching and learning and transfer to society, to serve students by teaching them leadership and problem-solving skills, and the values of quality, ethical behavior, responsibility to society and commitments to work, to pursue the advantages provided by a diverse community, open to the exchange of ideas, where discovery and artistic creativity can flourish. In any presentation, creative, artistic or research, it is the ethical responsibility of each student to identify the conceptual sources of the work submitted. Failure to do so is dishonest and is the basis for a charge of cheating or plagiarism, which is subject to disciplinary action. The university has a very clear and specific protocol for responding to alleged violations of academic integrity. Carnegie Mellon's Academic Disciplinary Actions Overview for Graduate Students describes procedures for disciplinary actions against graduate students in cases of alleged violations of academic regulations and the appeal process. Important note: The LTI implements the above policy\u2019s option of \u201cconven[ing] a disciplinary hearing according to the procedures of the department/program\u201d. Our procedure is as follows: a first violation is grounds for dismissal from the graduate program. If we decide to not immediately dismiss, the first violation will result in the student being on disciplinary probation. If a student commits a second violation while on probation, the penalty is dismissal from the graduate program. 6 Academic Policies 6.1 MIIS Academic Policies", "MIIS Graduate Student Handbook Page 24 6.1.1 Double Counting Courses A Masters student who uses courses taken as part of another degree program (at Carnegie Mellon or elsewhere) toward their program requirements cannot use those same courses toward any other M.S. degree offered by the School of Computer Science without prior approval. (SCS policy) 6.1.2 Duration of Study MIIS-16 students enrolled for full-time study are expected to complete the degree in three semesters of academic study and one summer internship (16 months total). MIIS-21 students enrolled for full-time study are expected to complete the degree in four semesters of academic study and one summer internship (21 months total). MIIS-16 students enrolled for part-time study are expected to complete the program in six semesters of academic stu dy and one summer internship (27 months total ). MIIS-21 students enrolled for part-time study are expected to complete the program in seven semesters of academic study and one summer internship (31 months total). See also the \u2018Statute of Limitations\u2019 policy. 6.1.3 Deferral MIIS students are given the opportunity to defer their enrollment. The deferral request must be approved by the program director. The deferral can only be used once for the period of one academic year. 6.1.4 Maximum and Minimum Course Loads A student in the program may not take more than sixty (60 ) units per semester without permission from the program director. A student in the program must be registered for a minimum thirty-six (36) units per semester to be considered a full-time student or twelve (12) units per semester to be considered a part-time student. All international students are required by US Federal law to maintain full-time status. Reduced Course Load is not permitted for MIIS students. Failure to maintain full-time status will result in loss of a student visa (and, therefore, \u201cpermit of stay\u201d). (MIIS policy) 6.1.5 Transfer Credit An equivalent graduate course previously completed at Carnegie Mellon, or another institution may be permitted to satisfy one of the MIIS breadth requirements. The decision on whether a course may be used to satisfy a breadth requirement is made by the MIIS Program", "MIIS Graduate Student Handbook Page 25 Director. Typically , the student will provide the Program Director with the syllabus of the external course, and the Program Director will use that and the student\u2019s transcript to make the decision. Satisfying a breadth requirement with a course from another institution does not reduce the number of CMU course units that must be taken to attain the MIIS degree. See the section on \u201cDefinition of transfer credit versus course exemption\u201d on page 2 5. 6.1.6 Transferring into the MIIS Program Transfers into the MIIS program are not permitted during a student\u2019s first semester at CMU. Students must begin their study at CMU in the program that admitted them. Students may request to transfer into the MIIS program after completing their first semester and before the add/drop deadline of the spring semester. The student must make the request in writing (or email) to the MIIS Program Director. The MIIS Program D irector will inform the student about what application materials are required, for example, an explanation of why a transfer is desired, a proposed plan of study, a proposed advisor, and CMU transcripts. Students that are already enrolled in an LTI degree program are not required to retake GRE and TOEFL /IELTS/Duolingo exams or to produce new transcripts from other universities. The MIIS program will conduct an expedited admissions process after receiving such a request. The program will explicitly consider whether the coursework done prior to the transfer will allow the student to be \u201con schedule\u201d by the end of the spring semest er, so that the student can participate in a capstone project with other MIIS students during the next fall semester. MIIS students are allowed to switch tracks (MIIS-16 to MIIS-21 and vice versa) after beginning their first semester at CMU. Ideally, all switch requests must be filed within the first semester of the program. It is highly recommended to not switch tracks more than once! Though not forbidden, multiple track switching may negatively impact immigration records of international students. Students also must understand that extension of their stay in the program will lead to additional financial obligations. U.S. citizens, virtually, have no restrictions on how many times they can switch if it is done for a legitimate reason. To confirm legitimacy of the reason to switch tracks ALL students must seek their advisor's approval and the approval of the Director of the MIIS program. 6.1.7 Transferring Out of the MIIS Program The MIIS program does not prevent students from transferring to another degree program. Each degree program has its own rules about whether and when transfers into the program are permitted. A student that is interested in transferring out of the MIIS de gree program should consult the handbook and Program Director of the desired degree program to learn whether transfers are permitted, and if so, how, and when to request such a transfer", "MIIS Graduate Student Handbook Page 26 6.2 LTI Academic Policies 6.2.1 Verification of Enrollment Enrollment Services is the only University office that can provide an official letter of enrollment, official transcript, and enrollment verification. Enrollment verification can be requested online through The HUB at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/student-records/verifications/enrollment.html. 6.2.2 \u201cGrandfather\u201d poli cy A student can graduate under the policies in effect at the time that the student entered the program; or, at the student's choice, the student can graduate under policies that are adopted after the student entered the program. If it is not realistic to fol low a particular policy exactly, the department may approximate the policy as closely as possible; this situation is rare and typically arises only when a student is enrolled in the program for an extended period . 6.2.3 Time Away from Academic Responsibilities Graduate students should not assume that their time-off follows the academic calendar of courses. Many are coming from an undergraduate environment where their university employment followed their course schedule. For many graduate degree programs, there i s an expectation that graduate students continue research during academic breaks and time away from campus which may or may not be negotiated with the students. If there are requirements for student time beyond a typical week day, this should be specified. Clarify that University Holidays are also student holidays, and students need to consult their faculty about coverage if they have challenges with taking time off during University Holidays. For example, if experiments are running that need to be monitored continuously students should speak with their faculty about arrangements to take an equal number of days off at another time. 6.2.4 Definition of transfer credit versus course exemption The LTI may grant transfer credit or issue an exemption for equivalent graduate courses previously completed at another institution. This decision rests with the director of the program . If a student is exempt from a required course due to prior courses or experience, the student can replace that course with an open elective. The student does not receive credit for the external course but can take any course that could normally count toward the degree in its place. If a student receives credit for prior cou rsework completed at CMU or elsewhere, the student receives that many units of credit, and the total amount of required coursework is reduced by that amount", "MIIS Graduate Student Handbook Page 27 6.2.5 External Employment/Consulting Since the M IIS program places heavy demands on student time, external employment and/or consulting are strongly discouraged. Exceptional students who wish to consult should discuss this with their Advisor. International students must also have approval in advance from the Office of International Education (OIE) for any outside employment. 6.2.6 Leave of Absence The LTI discourages Leaves of Absence (LOA), since students usually do not return, despite good intentions. However, a student in good standing may be granted a LOA of at most 1 year, upon written request to the Program Director and with consent of the student's advisor. It is the responsibility of the student on LOA to contact the LTI to initiate a return to the program. 6.2.7 Withdrawal of a Degree The University reserves the right to withdraw a degree even though it has been granted should there be discovery that the work upon which it was based or the academic records in support of it had been falsified. In such a case, withdrawal of the degree will occur promptly upon discovery of the falsification. The complete reference to this University policy is available at https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/withdrawal-of-a-degree.html . 6.2.8 Winter and Summer Breaks Students supported by research projects are expected to remain on campus working during breaks in classes. A two-week vacation is typically allowed in the summer. The normal winter break policy is that the student works 40 hours per week for two weeks and takes vacation for the other two weeks. 7 Safeguarding Educational Equity 7.1 Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities http://www.cmu.edu/education-office/disability-resources/ The Office of Disability Resources at Carnegie Mellon University has a continued mission to provide physical, digital, and programmatic access to ensure that students with disabilities have equal access to their educational experience. We work to ensure that qualified individuals receive reasonable accommodations as guaranteed by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Students who would like to receive accommodations can begin the process through Disability", "MIIS Graduate Student Handbook Page 28 Resources' secure online portal ( https://rainier.accessiblelearning.com/cmu/ ) or email access@andrew.cmu.edu to begin the interactive accommodation process. Students with physical, sensory, cognitive, or emotional disabilities are encouraged to self-identify with the Office of Disability Resources and request needed accommodations. Any questions about the process can be directed to access@andrew.cmu.edu , or call (412) 268-6121. 7.2 Sexual Misconduct Policy The University prohibits sex-based discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating/ domestic violence, and stalking. The University also prohibits retaliation against individuals who bring forward such concerns or allegations in good faith. The University\u2019s Sexual Misconduct Policy is available at https://www.cmu.edu/policies/administrative-and-governance/sexual-misconduct/index.html . The University\u2019s Policy Against Retaliation is available at https://www.cmu.edu/policies/administrative-and-governance/whistleblower.html . If you have been impacted by any of these issues, you are encouraged to make contact with any of the following resources: \uf0a7 Office of Title IX Initiatives o https://www.cmu.edu/title-ix/, 412-268-712 5, tix@cmu.edu \uf0a7 University Police o https:// www.cmu.edu/police/, 412-268-2323 Additional resources and information can be found at : https://www.cmu.edu/title-ix/resources-and-information/resources.html . 7.3 Gestational and Parental Accommodations https://www.cmu.edu/graduate/programs-services/maternity-accommodation-protocol.html Providing holistic student support is a top priority at Carnegie Mellon. The protocols on this page are designed to support the parental needs of students and their families. Students seeking any of the Parental Accommodations described below must register with the Office of the Dean of Students by contacting the office for an appointment by calling 412-268-2075", "MIIS Graduate Student Handbook Page 29 Students are encouraged to register with the Office of the Dean of Students ninety (90) days in advance of the anticipated arrival of the child as applicable in the individual circumstance. At the time of registering, students will have the opportunity to consult about resources, procedures, funding options and preparation for discussing academic accommodations with the student\u2019s academic department. Students should also consult with their academic advisors either before or in conjunction with registering with the Off ice of the Dean of Students. Accommodations for Gestational Parents The birth of a child is a significant life event that may require time away from academic pursuits for delivery and recovery from delivery of a newly born child. Students whose anticipated delivery date is during the course of a semester may need to take time away from their academic responsibilities. Carnegie Mellon students seeking time away are afforded two options as possible accommodation: \u2022 Short-Term Accommodation for Gestational Parents \u2013 A short term absence from academic responsibilities up to a maximum of six (6) weeks. Short-Term Accommodation may be extended by two (2) weeks, for a total of eight (8) weeks, where a longer absence is medically necessary. Prior to the absence students must work with relevant university faculty and staff to adjust their course work, research, teaching and other academic responsibilities during the period of absence. This may include extensions of time to complete assignments, incomplete grades, and/or dropping courses, shifting research responsibilities and adjusting TA assignments. Students who take a Short-Term Accommodation will remain enrolled. \u2022 Formal Leave of Absence \u2013 A formal leave of absence under the Student Leave Policy. Generally, the Student Leave Policy permits students to take a leave of absence for a full-semester, mini-semester, or for the time remaining in the semester during which the leave is taken. Students who take a Formal Leave of Absence ( https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/student-leave.html ) drop all remaining courses for the semester and are unenrolled for the semester. International students must consult with the Office of International Education ( https://www.cmu.edu/oie/ ) before considering this option due to visa implications. Financial Assistance for Student Parents Carnegie Mellon also offers the following options for financial assistance to students who become parents while enrolled: Interest Free Loan \u2013 Any student who becomes a parent is eligible to apply for an interest-free parental loan (https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/dean/loans/ ) from the Office of the Dean of Students. 7.4 Consensual Intimate Relationship Policy Regarding Undergraduate Students", "MIIS Graduate Student Handbook Page 30 This policy addresses the circumstances in which romantic, sexual, or amorous relationships/interactions with undergraduate students, even if consensual, are inappropriate and prohibited. The purpose of this policy is to assure healthy professional relationships. This policy is not intended to discourage consensual intimate relationships unless there is a conflicting professional relationship in which one party has authority over the other as in the policy. https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/consensual-relationships.html 7.5 Employment Eligibility Verification If you are receiving a stipend, are a TA, or are planning to have a position with CMU then Employment Eligibility Verification is required. Form I-9 must be completed within 3 business days of beginning work for any type of compensation (stipend or employm ent). Additional details are highlighted below. To ensure compliance with federal law, Carnegie Mellon University maintains the Employment Eligibility Verification (I-9) Policy https://www.cmu.edu/hr/assets/hr/restrict/employment-eligibility-verification-policy.pdf covering the university\u2019s I-9 and E-Verify requirements: \u25cf Every individual receiving a stipend from CMU or employed by CMU must comply with the I-9 Policy by completing the Form I-9 within three business days following the first day of stipend start date/employment. \u25cf Individuals who expect to work on a federally funded project are further responsible for submitting an E-Verify Processing Request Form to the Office of Human Resources if required. \u25cf For more information, please see CMU\u2019s Guidance for Completing the Form I-9 and E-Verify Requirements at CMU https://www.cmu.edu/hr/assets/recruiting/restrict/i-9-guidance.pdf , or visit the Human Resources Service website to learn more about Form I-9 and E-Verify https://www.cmu.edu/hr/service-center/new-faculty-staff/i-9-e-verify/index.html and to schedule an appointment to complete the Form I-9 https://go.oncehub.com/I9Appointment . \u25cf Students who fail to complete the Form I-9 in a timely manner may have stipend payments suspended.

Data Science Program. While this handbook is specific to your academic experience in the department, there are several other resources and offices graduate students are encouraged to consult during their tenure at Carnegie Mellon University. Information about The Word, the student handbook, the Office of Graduate and Postdoctoral Affairs, the Office of the Dean of Students, and others are included in Appendix A of this handbook. 1.1 The MCDS Degree The MCDS Degree The Master of Computational Data Science (MCDS) degree is a professional Master of Science degree offered by the Language Technologies Institute (LTI), a department in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. The MCDS degree offers students with a Bachelor's degree the opportunity to improve their training with advanced study in Computer Science and Machine Learning. We cater to students with basic analytic skills and a strong aptitude for mathematics, programming, and logical reasoning. An undergraduate degree in Computer Science is not required. Most students will complete the program in three semesters; students coming from other disciplines and students focus on developing applied research skills in preparation for further graduate study or research-oriented employment may require an additional fourth semester. The MCDS Program offers a core curriculum and several concentrations; students entering the program enroll in core courses in their first semester and select further courses to satisfy at least one concentration (see Section 3.3.6). Students construct their own course of study, in consultation with their academic advisor, in order to satisfy broad guidelines. Thus, a student may tailor their coursework in a given concentration to follow a particular area of emphasis. The MCDS program is typically a 16-month program consisting of courses, seminars, a required Capstone Project and a required summer internship or practical training. While some MCDS graduates continue on to PhD programs in the LTI or other leading universities, most graduates go on to jobs in", "7corporate research and development laboratories. The program consists entirely of coursework and a Capstone Project, and no Master\u2019s Thesis is required. All Capstone projects are structured as research activities and may lead to a publication. There is no Doctoral program in Computational Data Science. Because of the highly selective nature of the MCDS program and quality of the MCDS curriculum, performing well in the program will give a boost to a PhD application. MS graduates are welcome to apply to CMU PhD programs but will not receive preferential treatment. There are significant differences between CMU's different departments and degree programs in philosophical approach, procedures, policies and regulations. Each department issues a handbook that informs graduate students of their program requirements and procedures and ensures that students have written access to the standard information outlined below. This handbook describes the policies, procedures, and requirements for the Master of Computational Data Science (MCDS) degree. All policies not explicitly described in this document conform to School of Computer Science (SCS) policies and university policies described in The Word, Carnegie Mellon University Student Handbook and at the University Policies website. 1.2 Vision Carnegie Mellon University will have a transformative impact on society through continual innovation in education, research, creativity, and entrepreneurship. 1.3 Mission To create a transformative educational experience for students focused on deep disciplinary knowledge; problem solving; leadership, communication, and interpersonal skills; and personal health and well-being. To cultivate a transformative university community committed to (a) attracting and retaining diverse, world-class talent; (b) creating a collaborative environment open to the free exchange of ideas, where", "8research, creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship can flourish; and (c) ensuring individuals can achieve their full potential. To impact society in a transformative way \u2014 regionally, nationally, and globally \u2014 by engaging with partners outside the traditional borders of the university campus. 1.4 MCDS Contact Information The people responsible for administering the MCDS degree are: Jennifer M Lucas Academic Program Manager Master of Computational Data Science Language Technologies Institute School of Computer Science Carnegie Mellon University Gates-Hillman Center 6415 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pgh, PA 15213 Phone: (412) 268-9870 Fax: (412) 268-7287 Carolyn Penstein Ros\u00e9, Director Master of Computational Data Science Language Technologies Institute School of Computer Science Carnegie Mellon University Gates-Hillman Center 5419 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pgh, PA 15213 Phone: (412) 268-4525 Fax: (412) 268-7287 Robert Frederking Graduate Program Chair Language Technologies Institute School of Computer Science Carnegie Mellon University Gates-Hillman Center 6515 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pgh, PA 15213 Phone: (412) 268-6656 Mona Diab, LTI Director Language Technologies Institute School of Computer Science Carnegie Mellon University Gates-Hillman Center 5723 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pgh, PA 15213 Phone: (412) 268-3669 The Language Technologies Institute is located primarily on the 5th and 6th floors of the Gates Hillman Complex (GHC) on Carnegie Mellon\u2019s Pittsburgh campus: Language Technologies Institute Carnegie Mellon University 5000 Forbes Avenue Gates Hillman Complex 5402, LTI Pittsburgh, PA 15241-3891 412-268-6591 (phone) 412-268-6298 (fax) http://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/", "91.5 University Policies and Expectations Each member of the Carnegie Mellon community must be familiar with university policies and guidelines. In addition to this departmental graduate student handbook, the following resources are available to assist you in understanding community expectations: The Word/Student Handbook: http://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/index .html Academic Integrity Website: https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html University Policies Website: http://www.cmu.ed u/policies/ Office of Graduate and Post-Doc Affairs: http://www.cmu.edu/graduate/policies/index.html Please see Appendix A for additional information about university resources. 1.6 Carnegie Mellon University Statement of Assurance Carnegie Mellon University does not discriminate in admission, employment or administration of its programs or activities on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, handicap or disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status or genetic information. Furthermore, Carnegie Mellon University does not discriminate and is required not to discriminate in violation of federal, state or local laws or executive orders. Inquiries concerning the application of and compliance with this statement should be directed to the university ombudsman, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, telephone 412-268-1018. Obtain general information about Carnegie Mellon University by calling 412-268-2000. Carnegie Mellon University publishes an annual campus security and fire safety report. describing the university's security, alcohol and drug, sexual assault and fire safety policies, and containing statistics about the number and type of crimes committed on the campus, and the number and cause of fires in campus residence facilities during the preceding three years. You can obtain a copy by contacting the Carnegie Mellon Police Department at 412-268-2323. The annual security and fire safety report also is available online at www.cmu.edu/police/annualreports .

The Title IX", "10coordinator may be reached at 412-268-7125 or tix@cmu.edu . 1.7 The Carnegie Mellon Code Students at Carnegie Mellon, because they are members of an academic community dedicated to the achievement of excellence, are expected to meet the highest standards of personal, ethical and moral conduct possible. These standards require personal integrity, a commitment to honesty without compromise, as well as truth without equivocation and a willingness to place the good of the community above the good of the self. Obligations once undertaken must be met, commitments kept. As members of the Carnegie Mellon community, individuals are expected to uphold the standards of the community in addition to holding others accountable for said standards. It is rare that the life of a student in an academic community can be so private that it will not affect the community as a whole or that the above standards do not apply. The discovery, advancement and communication of knowledge are not possible without a commitment to these standards. Creativity cannot exist without acknowledgment of the creativity of others. New knowledge cannot be developed without credit for prior knowledge. Without the ability to trust that these principles will be observed, an academic community cannot exist. The commitment of its faculty, staff and students to these standards contributes to the high respect in which the Carnegie Mellon degree is held. Students must not destroy that respect by their failure to meet these standards. Students who cannot meet them should voluntarily withdraw from the university. The Carnegie Mellon Code can also be found on-line at: https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/ . 2 The Language Technologies Institute 2.1 Main Office The Gates Hillman Complex: Mailboxes, printers, copiers, and other departmental resources are in GHC 5404", "112.2 Photocopies and Printers The use of a printer/copier requires a CS user id (see the \u2018Computers\u2019 section). The School of Computer Science provides several black-and-white and color printers for use by students. SCS Computing Facilities maintains a list of printers: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~help/printing/. 2.3 Office Space for MS Students Full-time students in the LTI\u2019s MS degree programs on the Pittsburgh campus have access to a shared working space to create a sense of community and provide space for working when on campus. 2.4 Computers for MS Students Students are expected to provide their own laptop computers that can be used to access university resources and complete course assignments. Laptops running Windows, MacOS, and Linux software are all acceptable. MS students will be given a CS user id. A CS user id is required to use the LTI computer cluster, department printers, and other SCS services. The School of Computer Science has a Help Center located at 4203 GHC. They can be contacted at help@cs.cmu.edu , extension 8-4231 from a campus phone, or 412-268-4231 from an outside line. MS students will be given access to the LTI\u2019s computer cluster on an as-needed basis, to be used for course assignments, directed study projects, and/or the capstone project. The LTI cluster provides storage and computation for projects involving large datasets and/or lengthy computation. 3 MCDS Degree Completion and Certification This section describes the various rules and regulations that determine the attainment of a MCDS degree by the student. 3.1 CMU Degree Completion and Statute of Limitations Carnegie Mellon graduate students are expected to complete their degree requirements within the standard length of time for their program of study as outlined in the relevant Graduate Student Handbook. Standard program lengths for graduate students vary significantly \u2013 ranging from two semesters for some full-time master\u2019s programs to several or more years for doctoral programs. Upon completion of the graduate program degree requirements, the degree will be certified by the student\u2019s academic program in the semester in which the student completes the requirements. Early Completion Graduate students who consider the completion of all degree requirements in less than the standard length of time for their program of study may consult with their degree-", "12granting program or department to determine if early degree certification is allowed and under what circumstances. Extended or Longer-than-Standard Completion Longer-than-standard degree completion may occur due to academic interruptions in making progress toward the degree as defined by the academic program, interruptions of full-time study or progress towards the degree due to serious, documented medical issues, or other unusual or unforeseen circumstances. Master\u2019s students who require longer than the standard time to complete their degree requirements are expected to remain in close contact with their graduate program and will be certified at the end of the semester in which they have completed their degree requirements. Policy on Master\u2019s Student Statute of Limitations www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of-limitations.html See the above link regarding guidelines and restrictions which place an upper limit on the maximum length of time allowable for master\u2019s degree completion and certification. Additional Guidance for Students Program of study. Students seeking guidance about their program of study and degree requirements should consult with their academic advisor and/or appropriate associate dean. Financial aid and student account Students are expected to make normal progress toward their degree to graduate within the standard timeframe for their program of study. Under U.S. Federal Title IV regulations, student eligibility for federal financial aid is contingent upon enrollment in and successful completion of courses that are counted as credit toward their current degree program. To receive the maximum amount of federal financial aid for which they may be eligible, students must enroll each semester in at least 36 units that count toward their current degree level. (See separate guidance regarding integrated degree completion.) Students should consult with their designated college liaison in The HUB regarding billing and financial aid, particularly for early completion, longer-than-standard completion, or integrated undergraduate and master\u2019s degree programs. International students Immigration status for students in F-1 and J-1 non-immigrant status is tied to making normal progress toward completing degree requirements. Therefore, F-1 and J-1 students who are considering completing their degree requirements early, anticipating longer-than-standard completion, or moving from an undergraduate to a graduate student classification (integrated undergraduate-graduate study) should consult with their designated advisor in the Office of International Education (OIE) to ensure compliance with immigration regulations", "133.2 Full-time Status All MCDS students are expected to enroll full-time (at present, there is no option to pursue the degree as a part-time student). To be considered a full-time student, a student must be registered for, and complete, a minimum of 36 units in every Fall and Spring semester. All international students are required by US Federal law to maintain full-time status. Students can have no more than one (1) remote course counting toward the 36 units used to satisfy full-time enrollment. Failure to maintain full-time status will result in loss of a student visa (and, therefore, \u201cpermit of stay\u201d). All students having a Stafford Loan are required to maintain full-time status. 3.3 MCDS Degree Enrollment Process and Related Information 3.3.1 Duration of the degree program The MCDS degree must be completed within five (5) years from the time that the student matriculates into the program. https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of-limitations.html As outlined in the Master\u2019s Students Statute of Limitations (see link above), students will complete all requirements for the master\u2019s degree within a maximum of seven years from original matriculation as a master\u2019s student, or less if required by a more restrictive department, school or college policy. Once this time-to-degree limit has lapsed, the person may resume work towards a master\u2019s degree only if newly admitted to a currently offered master\u2019s degree program under criteria determined by that program. Under extraordinary circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, family or parental leave, or temporary disability, a school or college may, upon the relevant department's recommendation and with the written approval of the dean (or designate), defer the lapse for a period commensurate with the duration of that interruption. Students who are pursuing a master\u2019s degree as part-time students for all semesters of their program, as approved by their program, may also appeal to their program or department for extension of the time to degree limit. 3.3.2 Residency requirements There is no formal residence requirement. However, most courses in the program are taught on campus without an option for distance education. Students enrolled in in-person course sections (IPR) are expected to attend all class meetings in person. 3.3.3 Degree Certification: Course requirements and related policies/protocols", "14\uf0b7 In order to receive the MCDS degree, students must have a Quality Point Average (QPA) of 3.0. Completion of the degree is based on completing courses in the core curriculum, the MCDS seminar, electives and capstone project. \uf0b7 The capstone project consists of students working at CMU on a research project, or on an industry-sponsored project. \uf0b7 The student must complete 144 eligible units of study. This includes eight core and concentration courses, two 12-unit seminar courses and two 12-unit capstone courses. All students complete a common MCDS core in their first two semesters, consisting of five courses. All students must also complete at least one concentration, consisting of three courses in one of three areas: Analytics, Systems, or Human-Centered Data Science. The remaining elective course can be any course with number 600 or above chosen from the SCS course catalog. Any additional non-prerequisite units taken beyond the 144 units are also considered electives. \uf0b7 To maintain full-time enrollment status, a student must enroll in a minimum of 36 course units per semester. A student may not take more than 60 units per semester, without permission from their academic advisor. Students must maintain full-time enrollment status (minimum of 36 units) in their final semester. 3.3.4 Prerequisite Core Course All MCDS students are expected to pass the 11-637 Foundations of Computational Data Science course by the end of their first semester. Each student must pass 11-637 with a grade of \u201cB\u201d or better. 3.3.5 Plan of study The degree consists of two timing options based on the length of time the student spends working on the degree. The student chooses their timing at the start of the degree program (for visa requirements). Changes in timing are possible with the approval of the Director of the degree program and successful visa extension application with CMU\u2019s Office of International Education. Note that all degree options consist of the same amount of coursework: \uf0b7 Professional Preparation Track \u2013 a 16-month degree consisting of study for Fall and Spring semesters, a summer internship, and Fall semester of study. Each semester consists of a minimum of 48 units of study. This timing is typical for most students. The student graduates in December. \uf0b7 Research Preparation Track \u2013 a 20-month degree consisting of study for Fall and Spring semesters, a summer internship, and a second year of Fall and Spring study. Each semester consists of a minimum of 36 units of study. This timing is designed for students interested in extending their time at CMU for developing applied research skills in preparation for further graduate study or research-oriented employment. Note that the per-semester course load is lower, but the total cost is higher since four semesters of tuition are paid. This timing is also", "15recommended for students interested in pursuing a PhD after graduation. The student graduates in May. 3.3.6.1 MCDS Curriculum All MCDS students must complete 144 units of graduate study which satisfy the following curriculum: \uf0b7 11-637-Foundations of Computational Data Science \uf0b7 Four (4) additional MCDS Core Courses (10-601 Introduction to Machine Learning; 05-839 Interactive Data Science; 15-619 Cloud Computing; 11-631 Data Science Seminar; 48 units) \uf0b7 Three courses (3) from one area of concentration curriculum (36 units) \uf0b7 Three (3) MCDS Capstone courses (11-634, 11-635 and 11-632) (36 units) \uf0b7 One (1) Elective: any graduate level course 600 and above in the School of Computer Science (12 units) 3.3.6.2 Common MCDS Core Courses All MCDS students are required to complete four common core courses in their first two semesters: \uf0b7 10-601-Machine Learning \uf0b7 15-619-Cloud Computing \uf0b7 05-839-Interactive Data Science \uf0b7 11-631-Data Science Seminar 3.3.6.3 Areas of Concentration In addition to the common MCDS core, all students must complete at least one area of concentration, which consists of three courses in Analytics, Systems, or Human-Centered Data Science. Students consult with their academic advisor and choose one or more areas of concentration during their first semester, in preparation for enrolling in Spring classes. \uf0b7 Analytics concentration: o One (1) Machine Learning course o One (1) Software Systems course o One (1) big data course \uf0b7 Systems concentration: o 15-513 Introduction to Computer Systems (elective, prerequisite for many advanced Systems courses) o Three (3) systems project courses \uf0b7 Human-Centered Data Science concentration: o One (1) Methods course o Two (2) HCI courses", "16 A detailed list of courses satisfying each concentration is contained in the MCDS Program FAQ. 3.3.6.4 MCDS Capstone Courses All MCDS students complete three Capstone courses: \uf0b7 11-634-Capstone Planning Seminar (12 units) \uf0b7 11-635-Capstone Research (12 units) \uf0b7 11-632-Data Science Capstone (12 units) MCDS Program Learning Outcomes \uf0b7 Design, implement and evaluate the use of analytic algorithms on sample datasets. \uf0b7 Explain how a machine-learning model is developed for and evaluated on real world datasets. \uf0b7 Design and execute experimental data collection and present resulting analyses using appropriate user experience (UX) techniques including interactive data visualizations. \uf0b7 Apply and customize analytics, systems and human-centered data science techniques to application-specific data science requirements and objectives. \uf0b7 Identify tradeoffs among data science techniques (analytics, systems and/or human-centered) and contrast design alternatives, within the context of specific data science application domains. \uf0b7 Survey, interpret and comparatively criticize state of the art research talks and papers, with emphasis on constructive improvements. \uf0b7 Organize, execute, report on, and present a real world data science project in collaboration with other researchers/programmers.

Students electing to complete the Human-Centered Data Science (HCDS) concentration will also learn to: \uf0b7 Design, implement and evaluate a user experience prototype to allow for clear understanding of data science solutions. \uf0b7 Apply social and behavioral research methods to data science problems to understand the human aspects of data collection and analysis. Throughout their coursework, students will take introductory courses on all those topics, practice them in advanced courses and seminars and demonstrate all learned skills in their Capstone project and internship. Students are encouraged to choose elective courses in the curriculum according to their professional goals and mastery of the main subjects. 3.3.10 Capstone project The capstone project consists of students working in a team or individually on a project. The capstone project integrates the educational experience of the student. A capstone project is typically a CMU research project, or an industry sponsored project; occasionally students define capstone topics through communication with the faculty. Students interested in defining their own capstone topics should discuss with the MCDS faculty as early as possible. The capstone project is a great opportunity for a student (or student team) to \u201cshow off\u201d their unique skills and accomplishments. Capstone projects have been instrumental in the hiring decisions for several employers. 3.3.11 Elective courses Electives can be any graduate level course (numbered 600 or above) in the School of Computer Science. Students use their elective courses to enhance study in an area of interest or to explore new areas of interest. 3.3.12 Undergraduate courses Undergraduate courses are taken to address an area of weakness in the student\u2019s prior preparation. Undergraduate courses (numbered less than or equal to 599) may be taken pass/fail or for credit but do not count toward the 144 units of eligible study: The course and course grade will appear on the student\u2019s transcript, and the course grade will factor as part of the student\u2019s QPA", "183.3.13 Independent study course Independent study courses allow students to cover study of a particular area of interest, and are used when no formal course is available in a given subject area. Students who are interested in continuing to a Ph.D. degree often enroll in Independent Study, since it offers the opportunity to perform research directly with a faculty member. Independent study courses are considered electives. Each independent study course must be advised and approved by at least one faculty member. Agreement to supervise an independent study course is purely voluntary on the part of the faculty member. It is the duty of the student, therefore, to negotiate the terms and conditions of the independent study with the pertinent faculty members of CMU who will be supervising the study. These individuals are referred to as \u201cindependent study supervisors.\u201d Once the student finds someone who agrees to supervise such a course, he/she must: 1. Students wishing to take an independent study must request approval from their academic advisor and complete proposal before the first day of classes in a given semester: 2. Enter into an agreement with the independent study supervisor that includes course expectations, including deliverables. 3. Secure the \u201cIndependent Study Contract Form\u201d from the MCDS administrator. 4. Complete the form, provide a brief description of the work to be done, including deliverables and how they will be graded. 5. Secure signatures of both the student and the supervisor. Return the form to the MCDS administrator in order to obtain approval for the independent study from the Director. Independent study contracts must be submitted no later than on the last day of the first week of classes in a given semester. 3.3.14 Double counting courses No course may be used to complete two MCDS degree requirements, nor may a course satisfy requirements in two degree programs. 3.3.15 Courses outside of the School of Computer Science Elective courses in other Schools at Carnegie Mellon may be taken with prior permission of the Director. 3.3.16 Grades All courses offered by the SCS CMU are graded on the 4.3 grading standard http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/Grades.html. MCDS students must maintain a 3.0 overall average each semester to remain in good standing. A student must obtain a B-or better grade in all courses, which count towards core requirements. If a student", "19receives a C-or better, that course may count as an elective towards the degree requirements. All courses must receive a letter grade; courses taken pass/fail do not count towards the MCDS degree. Enrollment Services is the only University office that can provide an official letter of enrollment, official transcript and enrollment verification. Enrollment verification can be requested online through The HUB at: https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/student-records/verifications/ 3.3.17 Student Review, Academic Probation and Academic Actions The MCDS program conducts an academic progress review at the conclusion of each semester in order to monitor individual student progress towards graduation regarding the fulfillment of curricular requirements, course grades, and academic integrity. Should a student\u2019s effort fall below the acceptable level of academic performance and/or fail to meet standards and policies established by Carnegie Mellon University, the student may be dismissed from the program. Infractions After each academic progress review, each student will receive a letter indicating the result of the review and their standing in the program. If applicable, the letter will also note the following infractions by the student in the given semester: \uf0b7 Cumulative QPA is below 3.0, resulting in the student being put on Academic Probation (see below) \uf0b7 Cumulative QPA is below 2.6, resulting in academic probation or possible dismissal (see below) \uf0b7 Academic Integrity Violation (AIV) deemed an infraction by the MCDS committee (see 3.7.2) Minimum QPA and Academic Probation Students must maintain a cumulative QPA of 3.0 to remain in good standing with the program. Should a student\u2019s overall QPA drop below 3.0 during any given semester, he/she will be placed on academic probation for the following semester. In probation cases, the student will be required to \uf0b7 enroll in courses as advised by the academic advisor, \uf0b7 improve his/her grades to no less than an overall 3.0 QPA in the following semester, and \uf0b7 meet any other goal set by the advisor during that period (e.g., fulfilling a core course requirement). If a student\u2019s cumulative QPA drops below 2.6, the student will be considered at risk of being unable to complete the program and will be considered for dismissal. He/she will be required to meet the program director to discuss his/her situation. Only if, after that meeting, the MCDS program committee ascertains that the student is likely to complete", "20the remaining program requirements in the allotted time, the student will be allowed to continue his/her studies in MCDS, and dismissed otherwise. If the student is allowed to continue their studies, they will be placed on academic probation for the following semester and is subject to the requirements above. Dismissal A student may be dismissed from the program for any of the following cases: \uf0b7 If the student has been put on academic probation and failed to meet the remedial requirements set by the advisor in the following semester, or committed an Academic Integrity Violation deemed an infraction by the MCDS committee while on academic probation \uf0b7 If the student has a cumulative QPA of 2.6 or lower and the MCDS program committee does not ascertain that the student is likely to complete the remaining program requirements in the allotted time \uf0b7 If the student has committed two Academic Integrity Violation deemed infractions by the MCDS committee (see 3.7.2) \uf0b7 If the student has committed an Academic Integrity Violation infraction where the violation is deemed to be sufficiently egregious as determined by the MCDS program committee \uf0b7 If the student has been found to infringe a University Policy, where such infringement is deemed grounds for dismissal Students who realize that one of these situations may apply to them are strongly encouraged to meet with the academic advisor to discuss a plan to mitigate the situation. Students who find they are struggling in the program will have the best chances of success if they communicate early and often with the academic advisor. 3.3.18 Incomplete grades Carnegie Mellon University students are expected to complete a course during the academic semester in which the course was taken. However, if the instructor agrees, a grade of \u201cI\u201d (incomplete) may be given when a student has been unable to complete the work of a course. However, the work completed up to that date must be of passing quality and the grade of incomplete provides no undue advantage to that student over other students. By awarding an \u201cI\u201d grade, an instructor must specify the requirements for the completion of the work and designate a default letter grade in the event that the student fails to complete the remaining work. Students must complete the required course work by no later than the end of the following academic semester or sooner if required by the instructor", "21The instructor must record the permanent course grade by the last day of the examination period of the following semester, or the Registrar will automatically assign the default grade. If further work has not been completed after one semester and a default grade is rendered, the default grade will become the grade of record. 3.3.19 Change of grades and missing grades If a grade has been assigned in error, it can be changed to a different permanent grade. The procedure for changing a grade is as follows: \uf0b7 Discuss the matter with the course instructor; provide evidence that the grade issued was not the grade earned. \uf0b7 If the instructor agrees, the student should contact the program administrator to process a Change of Grade Form in order to correct the grade that was issued in error. Generally, the instructor is the final authority for a course grade. \uf0b7 If a grade has not been assigned, please notify the course instructor for the completion of a Missing Grade Form. 3.3.20 Qualifying examinations and procedures (or equivalent) None required. 3.3.21 Thesis/dissertation None required. 3.3.22 On transfer to another program If the requirements for the MCDS degree have not been completed when a student leaves to pursue another academic program, the degree will not be awarded. Completion of the MCDS degree does not guarantee admission into any doctoral degree program at Carnegie Mellon University. The courses that will be completed as part of the MCDS may serve to enhance one\u2019s application to these programs but will in no way insure admittance. 3.3.23 Intellectual property policy The MCDS degree program adheres to Carnegie Mellon University policy on intellectual property: http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/IntellProp.html 3.3.24 Teaching requirements None required. However, students are encouraged to apply for teaching assistant positions in courses where they have excelled. 3.3.25 Language proficiency requirements None required. However, non-native English speakers are encouraged to take advantage of the various support functions provided by the Intercultural Communication Center (ICC) and the Global Communication Center (GCC)", "223.3.26 Academic Integrity and Policies on Plagiarism and Cheating The university considers any form of cheating or plagiarism to be a serious violation of student ethics. The student is required to understand and rigorously follow only the permitted forms of collaboration as defined by the instructor in every class. The work you submit must be your own, unless you have clearly attributed it to others. You must not use the work of others without proper citation. And, you must not use resources, including other persons, except as authorized by the course or project for which you are submitting the work. Such conduct might be accepted or commonplace elsewhere, but it is not here. Be careful. Be warned. Failure to abide by these rules, even just once, can result in your permanent separation from the University without refund of money paid. Note that the policy requires the student to be informed and understand the academic integrity rules for every assignment or exam in a course. The MCDS program strives to produce graduates with the highest standards of academic integrity. Academic Integrity Violations are taken very seriously and the MCDS program has a zero tolerance policy for multiple Academic Integrity Violations. A single violation is grounds for dismissal from the graduate program if deemed sufficiently egregious as determined by the MCDS program committee. If a student commits a second violation, the expected penalty is dismissal from the graduate program (see also academic progress review at section 3.3.17). Please review the University Policy on Academic Integrity: https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html The policy includes the University expectations around academic integrity and provides definitions of cheating, plagiarism, and unauthorized assistance. A review of the University\u2019s Academic Disciplinary Actions procedures https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/academic-discipline/index.html is also recommended. These procedures outline the process for investigating, reporting, and adjudicating violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity. The procedures also outline the appeal process. 3.3.27 Process for Appealing Final Grades https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/academic/appeal-of-grades-and-academic-actions.html Final grades will be changed only in exceptional circumstances and only with the approval of the instructor and the department, unit or program. Grading is a matter of sound discretion of the instructor and final grades are rarely changed without the consent of the instructor who assigned the grade. The following circumstances are the unusual exceptions that may warrant a grade appeal: (a) the final grade assigned for a course is based on manifest error (e.g. a clear error such as arithmetic error in computing a grade or failure to grade one of the answers on an exam), or (b) the faculty or staff member who assigned the grade did so in violation of a University policy", "233.3.27 Teaching Assistants The MCDS degree does not have a teaching requirement. However, some students may wish to be a teaching assistant. MCDS students may petition for approval to TA up to one course per semester provided that they are in good academic standing (Overall QPA 3.0 or above). As required by the English Fluency in Higher Education Act of 1990, graduate students are required to have a certain level of fluency in English before they can instruct in Pennsylvania. Through this Act, all institutions of higher education in the state are required to evaluate and certify the English fluency of all instructional personnel, including teaching assistants and interns. The full university policy can be reviewed at: http://www.cmu.edu/policies/faculty/evaluation-certification-english-fluency-instructors.html . In addition to administering the International Teaching Assistant (ITA) Test (mandatory screening test for any non-native speaker of English), Language Support in the Student Academic Success Center helps teaching assistants who are non-native English speakers develop fluency and cultural understanding to teach successfully at Carnegie Mellon. Visit the website for additional information: https://www.cmu.edu/student-success/ 3.3.28 Internship Requirement and Search for Full Time Employment An internship is required for the degree program. In some cases, when a student has prior work experience, the Director of the degree program may waive this requirement. Students start searching for internships generally in the Fall and Spring semesters. Once the student returns from an internship in the Fall, they should immediately begin the search for full time employment. Extensive resources are available at http://www.cmu.edu/career/ including a resume submission system, a list of employers, on campus interviews and mock interviews, and many other resources. The Technical Opportunities Conference (TOC) http://engineering.cmu.edu/companies/toc/ occurs every September. This conference is one of the main recruiting events each year. All international students are required to apply for Curricular Practical Training (CPT). CPT is employment that is an integral part of an established curriculum and is directly related to the student\u2019s major area of study. Please visit the Office of International Education (OIE) link below to learn more about the CPT process: http://www.cmu.edu/oie/forstu/jobs.html", "243.4 Enrollment Verification Enrollment Services is the only University office that can provide an official letter of enrollment, official transcript and enrollment verification. Enrollment verification can be requested online through The HUB via this link: http://www.cmu.edu/hub/transcripts/verifications/enrollment.html 3.5 University Policies on Grades and Grading 3.6.1 University Policy on Grades This policy offers details concerning university grading principles for students taking courses and covers the specifics of assigning and changing grades, grading options, drop/withdrawals and course repeats. It also defines the undergraduate and graduate grading standards. You can review the university grading policies here: https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/grading.html 3.6.2 University Policy on Grades for Transfer Courses Carnegie Mellon University offers students the opportunity to take courses for credit through a cross-registration program (see Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE) and Cross-registration below) and through the receipt of transfer credit from other accredited institutions. The Carnegie Mellon University transcript will include information on such courses as follows: Carnegie Mellon courses and courses taken through the university\u2019s cross-registration program will have grades recorded on the transcript and be factored into the QPA. All other courses will be recorded on this transcript indicating where the course was taken, but without grades. Such courses will not be taken into account for academic actions, honors or QPA calculations. (Note: suspended students may take courses elsewhere; however, they may receive transfer credit only if their college\u2019s and department\u2019s policies allow this.) You can review the university policy here: https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/transfer-credit-evaluation-and-assignment.html 3.6 Academic Integrity 3.7.1 Expectations Regarding Proper Conduct In the midst of self-exploration, the high demands of a challenging academic environment can create situations where some students have difficulty exercising good judgment. Academic challenges can provide many opportunities for high standards to evolve if students actively reflect on these challenges and if the community supports", "25discussions to aid in this process. It is the responsibility of the entire community to establish and maintain the integrity of our university. Carnegie Mellon University educates its students to become professionals who will serve society with integrity. The university also creates and disseminates new knowledge and expressions of knowledge in ways that benefit society. Carnegie Mellon strives to serve the changing needs of society through the three primary goals outlined in its mission statement: to create and disseminate knowledge and art through research and artistic expression, teaching and learning and transfer to society, to serve students by teaching them leadership and problem-solving skills, and the values of quality, ethical behavior, responsibility to society and commitments to work, to pursue the advantages provided by a diverse community, open to the exchange of ideas, where discovery and artistic creativity can flourish. In any presentation, creative, artistic or research, it is the ethical responsibility of each student to identify the conceptual sources of the work submitted. Failure to do so is dishonest and is the basis for a charge of cheating or plagiarism, which is subject to disciplinary action. Please review the University Policy on Academic Integrity (https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html ). The policy includes the University expectations around academic integrity and provides definitions of cheating, plagiarism, and unauthorized assistance. A review of the University\u2019s Academic Disciplinary Actions procedures (https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/academic-discipline/index.html ) is also recommended. These procedures outline the process for investigating, reporting, and adjudicating violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity. The procedures also outline the appeal process. 3.7.2 Protocol for Academic Integrity Violations The university has a very clear and specific protocol for responding to alleged violations of academic integrity. Carnegie Mellon's Academic Disciplinary Actions Overview for Graduate Students describes procedures and the appeal process for disciplinary actions against graduate students in cases of alleged academic integrity violation. For more information on disciplinary actions please see: https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/acad_standards/creative/disciplinary.html Further documentation on how to respond to an allegation of a violation as a graduate student:", "26 https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/ocsi/academic-integrity/grads.html Important Note: MCDS implements the above policy\u2019s option of \u201cconven[ing] a disciplinary hearing according to the procedures of the department/program\u201d. We have adopted the following hearing procedure and \u201ctwo strikes\u201d rule: \uf0b7 If an instructor determines that an academic integrity violation has occurred, both the instructor and students are given the opportunity to explain the situation to the MCDS program committee. A written hearing by email suffices for this purpose. \uf0b7 The program committee then reviews all information and decides whether the violation is deemed an infraction (see 3.3.17), and which secondary actions are to be taken on the program level. \uf0b7 Two-Strike-Rule: MCDS may dismiss students upon a first AIV infraction. A second infraction will always lead to the offending student being dismissed from the program, with no exceptions. The MCDS program reserves the right to withdraw a degree even though it has been granted should there be discovery that the work upon which it was based or the academic records in support of it had been falsified. In such a case, the degree will be withdrawn promptly upon discovery of the falsification. The complete reference to this university policy is available at: https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/withdrawal-of-a-degree.html 4 Academic Policies 4.1 MCDS Academic Policies 4.1.1 Duration of Study MCDS students enrolled for full-time studies are normally expected to complete the degree in three semesters (16 months). This includes a summer internship. 4.1.2 Double-Dipping A Masters student who uses courses taken as part of another degree program (at Carnegie Mellon or elsewhere) toward their program requirements cannot use those same courses toward any other M.S. degree offered by the School of Computer Science without prior approval. 4.1.3 Pass/Fail and Audit Grades Pass/fail and audit grades are not permitted for courses used to satisfy a degree requirement. Graduate students who are required to take additional undergraduate courses to build up the core foundations of computer science may not elect the pass/fail or audit option for these courses", "274.1.4 Transfer Credit An equivalent graduate course previously completed at Carnegie Mellon, or another institution, may be permitted to satisfy one of the MCDS course requirements, with permission from the Director. Students must petition for transfer credit by providing the Program Director with the prior course syllabus and other details that may be required by the Director in order to make a decision. See the section on \u201cDefinition of transfer credit versus course exemption\u201d. NOTE: In all cases, credit may only be transferred from another degree program for courses deemed \u201cfree electives\u201d-i.e., courses which were not used to satisfy a core requirement or total units requirement in a prior degree program. All MS students are required to take a minimum of 96 units of coursework at CMU. 4.1.5 External Internships and Job Interviewing MCDS students are expected to attain an external internship during the summer. International students must coordinate carefully with the University, due to visa restrictions. International students are required to consult with the Office of International Education for eligibility before seeking an internship/co-op or signing an offer contract. We caution all students to be aware of potential intellectual property (IP) implications with internships, and to review any IP agreements with their academic advisor before signing them. It is possible to lose ownership of your own inventions if they occur during an external internship. While it is necessary for students to travel off-campus for job interviews, it is not acceptable for a student to miss a course requirement or a capstone project commitment due to interview travel. Students should work proactively with prospective employers to arrange interview travel in a way that minimizes the impact on their final semester course work. 4.1.6 Transferring into the MCDS Program Direct transfers into the MCDS program are not permitted. Students who are currently enrolled at Carnegie Mellon who wish to transfer into the MCDS program must do so by applying to the MCDS program via the normal admissions process. As specified in Sec. 4.1.4 in this document, some transfer credit and/or exemption from MCDS requirements may be possible on a case-by-case basis. 4.1.7 Transferring Out of the MCDS Program The MCDS program does not prevent students from transferring to another degree program. Each degree program has its own rules about whether and when transfers into the program are permitted. A student that is interested in transferring out of the MCDS degree program should consult the handbook and Program Director of the desired", "28degree program to learn whether transfers are permitted, and if so, how and when to request such a transfer. 4.1.8 Statute of Limitations https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of-limitations.html As outlined in the Master\u2019s Students Statute of Limitations (link above), students will complete all requirements for the master\u2019s degree within a maximum of seven years from original matriculation as a master\u2019s student, or less if required by a more restrictive department, school or college policy. Once this time-to-degree limit has lapsed, the person may resume work towards a master\u2019s degree only if newly admitted to a currently offered master\u2019s degree program under criteria determined by that program. Under extraordinary circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, family or parental leave, or temporary disability, a school or college may, upon the relevant department's recommendation and with the written approval of the dean (or designate), defer the lapse for a period commensurate with the duration of that interruption. Students who are pursuing a master\u2019s degree as part-time students for all semesters of their program, as approved by their program, may also appeal to their program or department for extension of the time to degree limit. 4.2 LTI Academic Policies 4.2.1 \u201cGrandfather\u201d policy A student can graduate under the policies in effect at the time that the student entered the program; or, at the student's choice, the student can graduate under policies that are adopted after the student entered the program. In unusual cases, the Director may approve exceptions to the program requirements. 4.2.2 Course Drop/Add/withdrawal procedures Students taking undergraduate and Master\u2019s level courses must follow the procedures and deadlines for adding, dropping, or withdrawing from courses as identified on the academic calendar. Information can be found at: https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/course-changes/index.html . There is a separate calendar for masters level courses. 4.2.3 Courses with restricted enrollment MCDS students have priority for the program core courses. The MCDS program administrators cannot intercede with other departments to secure seats for its students in other courses as all departments reserve seats for their accepted students. Usually all remaining open seats are assigned on a first-come, first-served basis. Students can,", "29on occasion, contact the assigned course instructor in order to plead his/her case for admission to the course. Admission may be granted at the discretion of the instructor. The policy of the department offering the course(s) is always followed. 4.2.4 Definition of transfer credit versus course exemption The LTI may grant transfer credit or issue an exemption for equivalent graduate courses previously completed at another institution. This decision rests with the Director of the particular program. If a student is exempt from a required course due to prior courses or experience, the student can replace that course with an open elective. The student does not receive credit for the external course but can take any course that could normally count toward the degree in its place. If a student receives credit for prior coursework completed at CMU or elsewhere, the student receives that many units of credit, and the total amount of required coursework is reduced by that amount. 4.2.5 External Employment/Consulting Since the MCDS program places heavy demands on student time, external employment and/or consulting are strongly discouraged. Exceptional students who wish to consult should discuss this with their advisor. International students must also have approval in advance from the Office of International Education (OIE) for any outside employment. 4.2.6 Leave of Absence A student in good standing may be granted a LOA of at most 1 year, upon written request to the Program Director and with consent of the student's advisor. It is the responsibility of the student on LOA to contact the program administrator to apply for a return to the program. 4.2.7 Withdrawal from Program Students may voluntarily withdraw from the MCDS program. If a student decides to withdraw, or is considering a withdrawal, she/he should contact the program administrator to schedule an advising meeting as soon as possible. The university\u2019s general withdrawal policy can be found here: https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/leaves-and-withdrawals/ 4.2.8 Satisfactory Progress If a student does not make satisfactory progress each semester toward completing the degree, the LTI may remove the student from the program. See section on \u201cEnd of Semester Evaluation\u201d. In particular, students in the three-semester program who fail one of their first-semester MCDS core required courses are strongly encouraged to consider switching to the four-semester program. 4.2.9 Winter and Summer Breaks", "30Students supported by research projects or working in an on-campus internship are expected to remain on campus working during breaks in classes. A two-week vacation is typically allowed in the summer for the students who are working on campus (not pursuing an external internship). Supported students should arrange their winter break time with their supervisor. 4.3 CMU Academic Policies 4.3.1 Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities http://www.cmu.edu/education-office/disability-resources/ The Office of Disability Resources at Carnegie Mellon University has a continued mission to provide physical, digital, and programmatic access to ensure that students with disabilities have equal access to their educational experience. We work to ensure that qualified individuals receive reasonable accommodations as guaranteed by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Students who would like to receive accommodations can begin the process through Disability Resources' secure online portal (https://rainier.accessiblelearning.com/cmu/ ) or email access@andrew.cmu.edu to begin the interactive accommodation process. Students with physical, sensory, cognitive, or emotional disabilities are encouraged to self-identify with the Office of Disability Resources and request needed accommodations. Any questions about the process can be directed to access@andrew.cmu.edu, or call (412) 268-6121. 4.3.2 Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures Graduate students will find the Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures on the Graduate Education Resource webpage. This document summarizes processes available to graduate students who seek review of academic and non-academic issues. Generally, graduate students are expected to seek informal resolution of all concerns within the applicable department, unit or program before invoking formal processes. When an informal resolution cannot be reached, however, a graduate student who seeks further review of the matter is to follow the formal procedures outlined here. These appeal and grievance procedures shall apply to students in all graduate programs of the University. Students should refer to the department specific information in this handbook for department and college information about the administration and academic policies of the program. You can review a summary of the university\u2019s graduate student\u2019s appeal and grievance procedures here: https://www.cmu.edu/graduate/policies/appeal-grievance-procedures.html 4.3.3 Safeguarding Educational Equity: Sexual Harassment and Sexual Assault", "31The University prohibits sex-based discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating/ domestic violence and stalking. The University also prohibits retaliation against individuals who bring forward such concerns or allegations in good faith. The University\u2019s Sexual Misconduct Policy is available at https://www.cmu.edu/policies/administrative-and-governance/sexual-misconduct/index.html . The University\u2019s Policy Against Retaliation is available at: https://www.cmu.edu/policies/administrative-and-governance/whistleblower.html If you have been impacted by any of these issues, you are encouraged to make contact with any of the following resources: \uf0b7 Office of Title IX Initiatives: http://www.cmu.edu/title-ix/ , 412-268-7125, tix@cmu.edu \uf0b7 University Police: https://www.cmu.edu/police/ , 412-268-2323 \uf0b7 Additional resources and information can be found at: https://www.cmu.edu/title-ix/resources-and-information/index.html 4.3.4 Consensual Intimate Relationship Policy Regarding Undergraduate Students https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/consensual-relationships.html This policy addresses the circumstances in which romantic, sexual or amorous relationships/interactions with undergraduate students, even if consensual, are inappropriate and prohibited. The purpose of this policy is to assure healthy professional relationships. This policy is not intended to discourage consensual intimate relationships unless there is a conflicting professional relationship in which one party has authority over the other as in the policy. 4.3.5 Gestational and Parental Accommodations https://www.cmu.edu/graduate/programs-services/maternity-accommodation-protocol.html Students whose anticipated delivery date is during the course of the semester may consider taking time away from their coursework and/or research responsibilities. Any student who gives birth to a child while engaged in coursework or research is eligible to take either a short-term absence or formal leave of absence. Students are encouraged to consult with relevant university faculty and staff as soon as possible as they begin making plans regarding time away. \uf0b7 Students must contact the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs to register for Maternity Accommodations.

These standards require personal integrity, a commitment to honesty without compromise, as well as truth without equivocation and a willingne ss to place the good of the community above the good of the self. Obligations once un dertaken must be me t, commitments kept. As members of the Carnegie Mellon community , individuals are expected to uphold the standards of the community in a ddition to holding others accountable for said standards. It is rare that the life of a student in an academic community can be so private that it will not affect the community as a whole or that the above standards do not apply. The discovery, advancement, and communicatio n of knowledge are not possible without a commitment to these standards. Creativity cannot exist without acknowledgment of the creativity of others. New knowledge cannot be developed without credit for prior knowledge. Without the ability to trust that these princ iples will be observed, an academic community cannot exist. The commitment of its faculty, staff, and students to these standards contributes to the high respect in which the Carnegie Mellon degree is he ld. Students must not de stroy that respect by", "8 their failure to meet these standards. Stud ents who cannot meet them should voluntarily withdraw from the university. The Carnegie Mellon Code can also be found online . 5 University Policies and Expectations It is the responsibility of each member of the Ca rnegie Mellon community to be familiar with university policies and guidelines.

Under exceptional conditions, such as for medical reasons, a student may be granted a leave of absence. See Section 11.1.10, below. Upon completion of the graduate program degree requirem ents, the degree will be certified by the student\u2019s academic program in the semester in whic h the student completes the requirements . 10.1 Course Grade and GPA Requirements To receive the M.S. degree, all students must take and successfully complete at least 195 units of coursework . All required Core Courses must be completed with a grade of B or better . For the Knowledge Area Courses, students must maintain a B average . No grade lower than C (or Pass in the case of Pass/No Pass courses) shall be used for credit appli ed toward graduation. Under SCS policy, only a grade of C or higher will be regarded as a Pass in a Pass/No Pass course. No undergraduat e courses count toward the 195-unit requirement. All Core courses are organized in sequence, and must be taken in the following order: \uf0b7 Artificial Intelligence and Future Markets (11-651) \u2013 No prerequisite. \uf0b7 AI Engineering (11-695) \u2013 Prerequisite is the co mpletion of 11-651 with a grade of \u201cB\u201d or better. \uf0b7 LTI Practicum (11-935) \u2013 Three credit units for completing the required Internship. \uf0b7 AI Innovation (11-654) \u2013 Prereq uisite is the completion of 11-695 with a grade of \u201cB\u201d or better. \uf0b7 Capstone (11-699) \u2013 Prerequisite is the completion of 11-654 with a grade of \u201cB\u201d or better. Students are required to repeat any required cour se that they have completed with a grade less than the required minimum, preferably at the nex t offering. (Please note that Core courses and Knowledge courses are only offered once per year.) Students will be allowed to retake a required course only once. If a student fails in the second attemp t, he or she will be dropped from the MSAII program. If a student fails an elective course, she or he will need to repeat the same or take a substitute course (equivalent course approved by the Director). All grades count towards the program QPA, exce pt for repeated courses, in which case the final grade replaces the previous grade. Courses taken pass/no pass do not affect the student\u2019s QPA. However, ONLY ELECTIVE COURSES MAY BE TAKEN PASS/NO PASS, unless the Provost directs to the contrary. Students who do not achieve the required minimum grade in a required course, who elect to take an \u201ci ncomplete\u201d in a required course, or whose cumulative grade point average is below a B (3.0), will be placed on academ ic probation. Students on probation are not eligible to graduate. Students who are placed on academic probation shall receive written notice of this finding, including a list of meas ures that need to be tak en to be removed from", "13 academic probation. A student on academic pr obation for two consecutive semesters may be dropped from the program. The MSAII program conducts an academic progress re view at the conclusion of each semester in order to monitor individual student progress towa rd graduation. Should a student\u2019s effort fall below the acceptable academic performance and/or fail to meet the sta ndards established by the MSAII program and Carnegie Mellon Universit y, the student may be dismissed from the program. Should a student\u2019s overall QPA drop below 3.0 d uring any given semester, he/she will be placed on academic probation for the following semester and will be required to improve his/her grades to no less than overall 3.0 QPA d uring that period. Failure to im prove to an overall 3.0 QPA or better the following semester may result in termin ation from the program. In addition, a student who violates policies established by Carnegie Mellon University may be dismissed from the program. After each academic progress revi ew, a student may receive one or more letters, indicating the result of the review. Warning letters are issued for the following cases: 1) Overall QPA below 3.0 (Academic probation) 2) Semester QPA is below 3.0 3) Grade below B in a Core course 4) Academic Integrity Violation (AIV) according to the university policies. This includes any AIV letter received in during the summer preceding matriculation. A student may be terminated from the program under any of the following circumstances: a) A student who has received two Academic Integrity Violation (AIV) letters will be terminated. There are no exceptions and the Program Director has no discretion over such a termination as it is an LTI policy. b) A student who has received one Academ ic Integrity Violation (AIV) letter may be terminated by the Program Director if the vi olation is so serious that the student cannot be allowed to remain in the MSAII Program. c) A student has received three warning letter s of any type from the MSAII program. d) A student has been found to have violated a University Policy for which termination is provided. An AIV letter or violation of University Poli cy may be appealed pursuant to CMU appeal procedures. See Section 4.5.2, be low. However, a decision to te rminate a student after appeal because of conditions a), b), c) or d) is not appealable. 10.2 Course Requirements", "14 1) Summer Before Entrance Admitted students are required to take, pa y for, and pass 15-513 Introduction to Computer Systems OR 11-637 Foundations of Computational Data Science during the summer prior to their arrival at Carnegie Mellon. The units earned in these courses are not counted toward the total number of units required for graduation. These courses may be taken pass/no pass, but cannot be dr opped. A student who drops either course during the summer will not be permitted to begin the degree program in the fall, but must retake one of the courses the following summer. The MSAII course offerings are available at msaii.cs.cmu.edu/curriculum . The university\u2019s complete Schedule of Classes can be found at https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/o pen/SOC/SOCServlet/search . Students are then required to take and su ccessfully complete the courses below: 2) The Core Courses (87 units)-Must be taken in THIS SEQUENCE: 11-651 \u2013 AI & Future Markets \u2013 (12 units). First Fall semester. Only open to MSAII. 17-762 \u2013 Law of Computer Technolo gy (12 units). First Fall semester 11-695 \u2013 AI Engineering (12 un its). First Spring semester 11-935 \u2013 LTI Practicum (3 units). Summer Internship 11-654 \u2013 AI Innovation (12 units). Seco nd Fall semester. Only open to MSAII. 11-699 \u2013 Capstone Project (36 units). Second Spring semester. Only open to MSAII. 3) The Knowledge Area Courses (72 units): 11-601, Coding Bootcamp (12 un its). First fall semester. 10-601, Machine Learning (12 units), First fall semester. (Normally 11-691, Math for Machine Learni ng, which is not being offered in Fall 2022.) 10-605, Machine Learning with Large Data sets (12 units). First spring semester. 11-611, Natural Language Processing (12 units). Second fall semester. 11-785, Deep Learning (12 unit s). Second spring semester. One more 12-unit AI, ML or NLP course of the student\u2019s choice (with approval of the Program Director) In the event that a course is not available, a course covering equivalent material with a similar degree of difficulty may be substitut ed with the permission of the Director. If a", "15 student has already taken an equivalent course and shows proficiency in the subject area, a more advanced course in the area may be taken in place of these required courses with permission of the Director. Graduate students cannot receive credit for undergraduate courses. 4) Electives: A minimum of 36 units of SCS courses must be taken. It is recommended to take one elective in the first fall semester, one or tw o in the first spring semester, one or two in the second fall semester and zero or one in the second spring semester. The courses below are automatically approved. A stud ent who wants to take a course not listed must obtain approval of the Director prior to registering. In general, the Director will approve any graduate SCS course of not more than 12 units. It is also possible to seek approval for courses in other Colleges at CMU. However, those courses must be rationally related to an AI career in order to be approved as electives. 11-636 MSAII Independent Study (may be tak en ONCE as an electi ve unless permission of the Director is obtained) 11-641 Machine Learning for Text Mining 11-642 Search Engines 11-676 Big Data Analytics 11-747 Neural Networks for NLP 11-755 Machine Learning for Signal Processing 11-777 Advanced Multimodal Machine Learning 11-791 Design of Intelligent Information Systems 10-605 Machine Learning with Large Datasets 10-608 Conversational Machine Learning 10-702 Statistical Machine Learning 15-624 Foundations of Cyber-Physical Systems 15-645 Database Systems 15-681 AI: Representation and Problem Solving 15-688 Practical Data Science 16-720 Computer Vision 16-725 Medical Image Analysis 16-772 Sensing and Sensors 16-824 Visual Learning and Recognition 17-637 Web Application Development 17-639 Management of Software Development 17-652 Methods: Deciding What to Design 17-653 Managing Software Development 17-766 Software Engineering for Startups", "16 02-604 Fundamentals of Bioinformatics 02-718 Computational Medicine Independent study (11-636) is encouraged. The process is that you find a faculty member willing to supervise your independent study, assign a number of credits not to exceed 12, and assign a grade at the end of the study. Th e faculty member must send an email to the Director indicating such wi llingness. You can then register for 11-636. Courses carrying more than 12 units in a se mester are NOT APPROVED as electives. Students may take athletics or music or th eatrical performance courses that do not require work outside of class times. Ho wever, such courses will NOT count toward the 195 units required for graduation. 10.2.1 Incomplete Grades Carnegie Mellon University students are expect ed to complete a course during the academic semester in which the course was taken. Howeve r, if the instructor agrees, a grade of \u201cI\u201d (incomplete) may be given when a student has b een unable to complete the work of a course. However, the work completed up to that date must be of pa ssing quality and the grade of incomplete provides no undue advantage to that student over other students. By awarding an \u201cI\u201d grade, an instructor must spe cify the requirements for the completion of the work and designate a default letter grade in th e event that the student fails to complete the remaining work. Students must complete the required course work by no later than th e end of the following academic semester or sooner if required by the instructor. The instructor must record the permanent cours e grade by the last day of the examination period of the following semester , or the Registrar will automatica lly assign the default grade. If further work has not been completed after o ne semester and a default grade is rendered, the default grade will become the grade of record. 10.2.2 Change of grades and missing grades If a grade has been assigned in error, it can be changed to a different permanent grade. The procedure for changing a grade is as follows: \uf0b7 Discuss the matter with the course instructor; provide evidence th at the grade issued was not the grade earned", "17 \uf0b7 If the instructor agrees, the student should contact the prog ram administrator to process a Change of Grade Form in or der to correct the grade that was issued in error. Generally, the instructor is the final authority for a course grade. \uf0b7 If a grade has not been assigned, please notify the course instructor for the completion of a Missing Grade Form. 10.2.3 Transferring to another program A student may withdraw from th e MSAII program at any time. If any requirement for the MSAII degree has not been met, the degree will not be awarded. O ccasionally, students are accepted into a different degree pr ogram at CMU and transfer to that program. International students who do this should ch eck with OIE to ensure that th eir visa is not jeopardized. 10.2.4 Intellectual Property Policy See http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/IntellProp.html . 10.2.5 Teaching Requirements None. Students who wish to do so may apply for teaching assist ant positions for courses in which they have excelled. It is important to ensure that the student\u2019s academic responsibilities are not adversely impacted by a TAship, and vice-versa. 10.3 Advising 10.3.1 Student Advising Every MSAII student will be assigned an advisor, normally the Program Director. Before the course registration period each semester, students must meet with their advisor to discuss their course selection. New students wi ll be given instructions to regist er for their classes during the summer prior to entrance. 10.3.2 Monitoring Progress The advisor meets with the student at least twic e a year, providing guidance and monitoring the student\u2019s overall progress. 10.3.3 Degree Certification Students who graduate having met all the requ irements for the degree will receive a diploma stating that they have received a \u201cMaster of Science in Artifici al Intelligence and Innovation.\u201d", "18 10.4 Internship Students must obtain an internship during the summer between the first and second years of the program. This is a requirement. An internship will provide stu dents with the opportunity to apply the knowledge and technical skills learned d uring the first year of the program, to gain insight into AI and future marke t needs to further their experienc e and develop a strong context for the second-year concentration coursework. No rmally the internship wi ll be with an outside company. In some circumstances, a student wh o is doing research with a CMU faculty member during the summer may request that such research qualify as an internship. The internship must involve at le ast two months of full-time work and must relate to computer software development and is preferably AI-related. Students are encouraged to intern with an organiza tion that corresponds to their individual area of interest and career goals. All students who secure summer internships must register for three units in 11-935 (LTI Practicum). This course can be taken once du ring the program with Pass/Fail and will be counted toward graduation units. Internationa l students must apply for Curricular Practical Training (CPT) for the internship by contacting the Office of International Education (OIE). To obtain CPT, students need an offer letter spelling out employment dates, work hours, and wages or stipend. It is the student\u2019s responsibility in 11-935 to give a presentation during the semester following the internship to a ll current MSAII students detailing the student\u2019s internship experience. International students who are in terested in working in the U.S after graduation are required to consult with the Office of International Educat ion (OIE) which oversees the OPT registration. Note: OPT must only be used after students have completed their degree at Carnegie Mellon. NOTE : Students are personally respon sible for securing a suitable internship. The Career and Professional Development Center will assist in their search for counseling, workshops, and internship opportunity listings in Handshake . We strongly suggest students begin the internship search beginnin g in the Fall of your first year. So me internship opportunities have application deadlines in the Fall, so by starting your search ea rly, you won't miss out on these internships. The Career and Pr ofessional Development Center will assist students with the internship search, but does not match students with employers; obtaining an internship is the students\u2019 responsibility. The following steps are recommended to ensure a successful internship outcome. Many of the events below have been modified due to COVID. September/October \uf0b7 Meet with your advisor to discuss your in terests and plan your internship search", "19 \uf0b7 Review the internships of previous students. We also encourage you to speak informally with second-year students who can offer firs t-hand information about their internships. \uf0b7 Attend the Technical Opportunities Conferenc e (TOC) at Carnegie Mellon for exposure to potential employers for internships. November/December \uf0b7 Begin researching organizations and internsh ip opportunities. Pay close attention to organizations that have established inte rnship programs and their deadlines. \uf0b7 Attend workshops to perfec t your resume, hone your inte rviewing skills, and gain knowledge about the intern ship search process. January/February \uf0b7 At this point, you should have a \u201cshort list\u201d of organizations at which you would like to intern. This list can include organizations th at have established internship programs as well as those that interest you without formal internship programs. \uf0b7 Update your resume with relevant ac ademic projects, coursework, etc. \uf0b7 Begin utilizing your network for internship leads as well as checking organization\u2019s websites for internships. \uf0b7 Make contact with employers, sending resume s and applications, and initiating internship interviews in person or by phone. \uf0b7 Attend Network Nights and talk to alumni about internship opportunities in their organization. They are an excellent resourc e for learning more about a particular organization, career field or employment oppo rtunity. You can find alumni in the Alumni Directory, Alumni Career Advisor Networ k, and Carnegie Mellon Alumni LinkedIn Network. March/April \uf0b7 At this point, you should ha ve secured an internship or be interviewing with various organizations. \uf0b7 Prepare a backup plan if your first ch oices of internships do not work out. \uf0b7 Attend relevant Network Nights and Career Fairs at Carnegie Mellon. \uf0b7 If you are an F-1 Visa student, you must apply for CPT. \uf0b7 MSAII students should enroll in 11-935 for three units. You will not have to pay tuition for this course. 10.5 Employment Eligibility Verification If you are receiving compensation or a stipend from CMU, if you are going to be a TA or you are planning to seek a position with CMU, then Em ployment Eligibility Verification is required. Form I-9 must be completed within 3 busine ss days of beginning work for any type of compensation (stipend or employment). Addi tional details are highlighted below", "20 To ensure compliance with federal law, Carnegie Mellon University maintains the Employment Eligibility Verification (I-9) Policy [pdf] covering the university\u2019s I-9 and E-Verify requirements: Every individual receiving a stipend from CMU or employed by CMU must comply with the I-9 Policy by completing the Form I-9 within thre e business days following the first day of stipend start date/employment. Individuals who expect to work on a federally funded projec t are further responsible for submitting an E-Verify Processing Request Form to the Office of Human Resources. For more information, please see CMU\u2019s Guidance for Completing the Form I-9 and E-Verify Requirements at CMU [pdf] , or visit the Human Reso urces Service website to learn more about Form I-9 and E-Verify and to schedule an appointment to complete the Form I-9. 10.6 MSAII Orientation Each Fall semester, the MSAII pr ogram provides a program orientation to help new students learn about the program. All new students are re quired to attend them and treat them seriously because they explain the program sequence, it s Core and Knowledge co urses requirements and how students will meet the program learning outcomes. 10.7 End of Semester Evaluation The MSAII program conducts an academic progress re view at the conclusion of each semester in order to monitor individual student progress towa rds graduation. Should a student\u2019s effort fall below the acceptable level of academic perfor mance and/or fail to meet the standards established by the MSAII program, the stud ent may be dismissed from the program. After each academic progress revi ew, a student may receive one or more letters, indicating the result of the review. See Section 3.1, Co urse Grade and GPA Requirements, above. At the end of the semester, the faculty evaluate s each student's academic progress. If a student seems to be having trouble, th e faculty determines whether it believes that the student can finish the degree, and if so, what needs to be accomplished to get back on track. This type of letter should be considered a serious warning. It is not a permanent \"black mark\" on the student's record; if the student begins making sa tisfactory progress again, there is no official record of the letter in the student's transcript. In the most serious cases, the faculty gives the stud ent a letter that specifies a list of conditions that the student must satisfy by specific deadlines . Failure to meet all of the specified conditions may result in the student's te rmination from the program", "21 10.8 Enrollment Verification Enrollment Services is the only University office th at can provide an official letter of enrollment, official transcript, and enrollment verification. Enrollment verification can be requested online through The HUB at www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/student-records/transcripts/ . 10.9 University Policies on Grades and Grading 10.9.1 University Policy on Grades www.cmu.edu/policies/student-an d-student-life/grading.html This policy offers details concerning university grading principles for students taking courses and covers the specifics of assigning and changi ng grades, grading options, drop/withdrawals, and course repeats. It also defines the un dergraduate and graduate grading standards. 10.9.2 University Policy on Grades for Transfer Courses & PCHE www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/transfer-credit-evaluation-and-assignment.html Carnegie Mellon University offers students the o pportunity to take courses for credit through a cross-registration program (see Pittsburgh Co uncil on Higher Education (PCHE) and Cross-registration below) and through the receipt of tr ansfer credit from other accredited institutions. The Carnegie Mellon University transcript will in clude information on such courses as follows: Carnegie Mellon courses and courses taken throug h the university's cross-registration program will have grades recorded on the transcript and be factored into the QPA. All other courses will be recorded on this transcript indicating where the course was taken but without a grade. Such courses will not be taken into account for academic actions, honors or QPA calculations. (Note: Suspended students may take courses elsewhere; ho wever, they may receive transfer credit only if their college\u2019s and department's policies allow this.) The MSAII program does not accept transfer credit for courses taken prior to matriculation at Carnegie Mellon. The MSAII program does not accept distance education credits except for distance courses offered by Carnegie Mello n or PCHE institutions. 10.10 Academic Integrity Carnegie Mellon\u2019s Academic Integrity policy is posted at https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html. All students", "22 are expected to be familiar with this policy, including the university-wi de protocol for handling academic integrity violations. The policy incl udes the University expectations around academic integrity and provides definitions of cheati ng, plagiarism, and unauthorized assistance. A review of the University\u2019s Academ ic Disciplinary Actions procedures (https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/th eword/academic-discipline/index.html ) is also recommended. These procedures outline the proc ess for investigating, reporting, and adjudicating violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrit y. The procedures also outline the appeal process. It is an absolute requirement that the work you submit must be your own, unless you specifically identify the source of any material th at is not yours. This includes quotations and material from websites. In any written work (including presentations) you MUST list any person other than yourself who assisted you in preparing that wo rk. Any student who violates the academic integrity policy will be subject to a University review that may result in suspension or expulsion under University policies. THE PROGRAM DIRECTOR, THE FACULTY AND THE UNIVERSITY ARE VERY SERIOUS ABOUT ENFORCEMENT OF THE ACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY. You are not permitted to copy material from web pages, including Wikipedia, and present them as your own work. Any copied material MUST appe ar in quotation marks or italics and MUST be accompanied by a citation to the original source. Failure to do this violates CMU\u2019s Policy on Academic Integrity, which states, \u201cIn all academic work to be graded, the citation of all sources is required. \u2026 Plagiarism is defined as the use of work or concepts contributed by other individuals without proper attribution or citation . Unique ideas or materia ls taken from another source for either written or oral use must be fully acknowledged in academic work to be graded.\u201d It is a violation of academic integrity for you to assist anyone else in violating the policy or to provide your work to others to assist them. Be cause team deliverables are the product of joint work, it is the responsibility of each member of a team to ensure that all team materials have been produced in conformance with CMU policies. Credit cannot be given fo r work that is not a student\u2019s own. Therefore, if one member of a team violates a policy, for example, by copying material from the Internet without indicating it s source, then no one on the team can receive credit for that work, even if only one studen t is directly guilty of violating the policy. We are aware that acts that constitute cheating can be viewed very di fferently in different countries and cultures. However, Carnegie Me llon is a U.S. university and its policies reflect U.S. culture. Employers expect that students who graduate from Carnegie Mellon have obtained their degree legitimately and according to Carnegie Mellon policies. If you have any doubt whether proposed conduct would be consi dered cheating under Carnegie Mellon policies, ASK A FACULTY MEMBER OR THE DIRECTOR FIRST", "23 All violations of the Academic Integrity policy MUST be reported to the University administration by the faculty members involved. Copies go to the Program Director, the Head of the Language Technology Institute, the Associate Dean for Master\u2019s Programs, and various officials at Warner Hall. The faculty do not ha ve the option to decli ne to make a report. The offending student will receive an email to inform them of an A cademic Integrity Violation (AIV). The email will specify the offense and the penalt y, and will inform the student of available appeal procedures. An AIV that is successfully appealed is erased. Important note: The university policy gives a depart ment the option of \u201cconven[ing] a disciplinary hearing according to the procedure s of the department/pro gram.\u201d The LTI has a \u201ctwo strikes\u201d rule. The LTI may terminate a st udent for a first violation, depending upon the circumstances and severity of the violation. The LTI always terminates a student for a second violation, with no exceptions. 11 Academic Policies 11.1 Course Registration 11.1.1 Status All Students must be registered for at least 48 units during each semest er. Any questions about registration should be directed to the Enrollment Serv ices (the HUB). Note that International students are required to be re gistered as full-time students, minimum 36 units . 11.1.2 Academic Calendar The Academic Calendar can be found at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/calendar/ . All dates about registration, add/drop deadlines, university ho lidays and more can be found there. 11.1.3 Online Registration All new students will register for required courses in Apri l after accepting admission and receiving an Andrew ID. After that, students wi ll register following th e schedule set by the HUB. Note that students must meet with thei r advisor to obtain approval for their course selection. Registration information is available at www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/registration/index.html . Online registration is done with an Andrew ID at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/sio/about.html . Students must register for at le ast 48 units per semester", "24 11.1.4 Double-Dipping An MSAII student who applies courses taken as part of another degree program (at Carnegie Mellon or elsewhere) toward their program requ irements cannot use those same courses toward any other M.S. degree offered by the School of Computer Science without prior approval. 11.1.5 Pass/No Pass Courses (Pass/Fail) With the approval of the Program Director , a graduate student may choose to take one ELECTIVE course pass/no pass. Core courses an d Knowledge courses may not be taken pass/no pass. By the deadline for changing a course to pass/no pass, the student must fill out the Pass/No Pass Approval Form and receive permissio n from their advisor. A pass/no pass election is irrevocable as a matter of CMU policy. (A form can be found at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/forms.html ) 11.1.6 Auditing a Course With the approval of the Program Director, a gr aduate student may audit a course by obtaining the permission of the instructor or teaching department and completi ng the Course Audit Approval Form. Audited classes are not taken for credit and cannot be used to fulfill graduation requirements. (Audit form can be found at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/forms.html ) 11.1.7 Adding a Course During the ADD period of each se mester (the first two weeks of the semester), students may add a course by registering online. After the ADD dead line, they may add a course by completing the Late Add Request form and obta ining the permission of both: 1) the instructor or teaching department and 2) their advisor. (Add form can be found at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/forms.html ) 11.1.8 Dropping a Course Dropping courses is not recommended except for reas ons of health or fami ly emergency. Many SCS courses have long waitlist s, and dropping a course means that some other student who might have had the opportunity to take the course had been denied that ability. Also, if students in the MSAII program drop courses, then the inst ructors of those courses may no longer allow MSAIIs to enroll. Sometimes, however, a student\u2019s workload can become unexpectedly heavy because of course requirements. No one is expected to suffer from such pressure a nd dropping a course may become a necessity. To avoid this unfortunate circumstance, yo u should inform yourself in advance of the curriculum and workload in each co urse you plan to take and ensure that you are capable of handling the load. Note that CMU SCS courses are very di fficult, and students who", "25 may easily have handled taking five courses sim ultaneously at another institution may not be able to do so at CMU. Exact add, drop and withdrawal dates may be fou nd on the official Academic Calendar. Up until the deadlines, students can initiate course adds and drops through Student Information Online (SIO). Courses dropped by the deadline will not appear on the student's record, and courses withdrawn from by the deadline will receive a 'W ' grade. Additionally, a voucher process has been implemented for late drops. Students taking undergraduate and Master\u2019s level courses must follow the procedures and deadlines for adding, dropping, or withdrawing from courses as identified on the academic calendar. Information can be found at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/course-changes/index.html . Late Course Drops & Vouchers A late drop voucher system was implemented begi nning with the fall 2018 semester to permit a limited number of late course drops. Master's st udents are permitted one drop voucher per year of study and may use only one voucher per se mester (including summer). Courses dropped using a voucher will be removed from the student' s record, as long as the drop is confirmed in SIO by the student within 24 hours of rece iving the automated voucher email (refer to instructions below). Students may use drop vouche rs up until the last day of classes each semester. These policies are spelled out at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/course-changes/index.html . Note that the Core courses and some Knowledg e courses are only offe red once per year so dropping a course may delay program completion. Note: International students must maintain a minimu m of 36 units (Full time) to meet the U.S. government\u2019s visa requirement. Please check with the Office of International Education (OIE) for more information. 11.1.9 Transfer Credits https://www.cmu.edu/policies/st udent-and-student-life/trans fer-credit-evaluation-and-assignment.html Carnegie Mellon University offers students the o pportunity to take courses for credit through a cross-registration program (see Pittsburgh Co uncil on Higher Education (PCHE) and Cross-registration below) and through the receipt of tr ansfer credit from other accredited institutions. The Carnegie Mellon University transcript will in clude information on such courses as follows: Carnegie Mellon courses and courses taken throug h the university's cross-registration program will have grades recorded on the transcript and be factored into the QPA. All other courses will be recorded on this transcript indicating where the course was taken, but without grades. Such", "26 courses will not be taken into account for academic actions, honors or QPA calculations. (Note: suspended students may take courses elsewhere; ho wever, they may receive transfer credit only if their college's and department's policies allow this.). The MSAII program does not accept transfer credits. 11.1.10 Leave of Absence Students who need to delay their studies for pers onal, medical or academic reasons may do so with a leave of absence (leaving the universit y temporarily with a co mmitment to return). Students must contact the MSAII Director to discuss their plans and fill out the appropriate form. The student\u2019s place in the program will be held until a mutually determined time. For more information refer to www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/student-leave.html . When planning to return from Leave of Abs ence students must complete the appropriate paperwork before returnin g to the University. MSAII students who require longer than the standard time to complete their degree requirements are expected to remain in close contact with the program, and will be certified at the end of the semester in which they have co mpleted their degree requirements. Students must refer to the CMU Policy on Master \u2019s Student Statute of Limitations (https://www.cmu.edu/policies/ student-and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of-limitations.html ) regarding guidelines and restrictions which place an upper limit on the maximum length of time allowable for maste r\u2019s degree completion and certification. 11.1.11 Additional Guidance for Students Program of study . Students seeking guidance about their program of study and degree requirements should consult with their academic advisor and/or appropriate associate dean. Financial aid and student account. Students are expected to make normal progress toward their degree in order to graduate within the st andard timeframe for their program of study. Under U.S. Federal Title IV regulations, student eligibility for federal financial aid is contingent upon enrollment in and successful completion of courses that are counted as credit toward their current degree program. To receive the maximum amount of federal financial aid for which they may be eligible, students must enroll each semester in at least 36 units that count toward their current degree level. (See separate guidance regarding integrated degree completion.) Students should consult with their designated co llege liaison in The HU B regarding billing and financial aid, particularly for early completion , longer-than-standard completion, or integrated undergraduate and master\u2019s degree programs. International students . Immigration status for students in F-1 and J-1 non-immigrant status is tied to making normal progress toward completing degree requirements. Therefore, F-1 and J-1", "27 students who are considering completing their de gree requirements early, anticipating longer-than-standard completion, or moving from an un dergraduate to a graduate student classification (integrated undergraduate-graduate study) should consult with their designated advisor in the Office of International Education (OIE) to ens ure compliance with immigration regulations. 11.1.12 Withdrawal Students who need to withdraw from the program (leave the university with no intention of returning) for personal, medical or academic reasons must contact the MSAII Director to discuss their plans and fill out the appropri ate form. For more information refer to www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/student-leave.html . 11.2 Tuition and Fees Information about tuition and fees is available at https://www.cmu.edu/sfs/tuition/index.html . MSAII students will pay tuition according to the ra tes set for the School of Computer Science. All tuition and fees must be paid in full by the due date; a student not in good financial standing will be dismissed from the program. Students ta king summer courses must pay tuition. 11.3 Graduation Ceremonies The University holds one Commencement ceremony in May of each year. Only students who have completed their degree requirem ents may participate in Commencement. There are no August or December commencement ceremonies. 11.3.1 Withdrawal of Degree A degree once conferred can be withdrawn by the University under certain circumstances. See the Withdrawal of Degree Policy . 11.4 LTI Academic Policies 11.4.1 \u201cGrandfather\u201d policy A student can graduate under the policies in effect at the time that the student entered the program; or, at the student's choice, the student can graduate under policies that are adopted after the student entered the program. If it is no t realistic to follow a particular policy exactly, the department may approximate the policy as closely as possible; this situation is rare and typically arises only when a student is enrolled in the program for an extended period", "28 11.4.2 Definition of transfer credit versus course exemption The LTI may grant transfer credit or issue an exemption for equivalent graduate courses previously completed at another institution. This decision rests with the program director, on the advice of the faculty memb er for whose course an exempt ion is sought. If a student is exempt from a required course due to prior courses or experience, the student can replace that course with an open elective. The student does not receive credit for the exempted course but can take any course that could normally count toward the degree in its place. If a student receives credit for prior coursework completed at Car negie Mellon or elsewhere, the student receives that many units of credit and the to tal amount of required coursework is reduced by that amount. 11.4.3 Employment/Consulting Since consulting provides useful experience, stu dents are generally permitted to consult at most one day per seven-day week, with the Program Di rector's consent. International students must also have approval in advance from the Office of International Educat ion (OIE) for any paid position. Students may use their consulting time to perform unpa id work on research projects for CMU faculty for up to 10 hours per week. Students may serve as teaching assistants for CMU faculty. TA work is inconsistent with research because of the necessary time commitm ent. Students must choose one activity or the other, not both. Note that there is an English language proficienc y requirement for TAs. Graduate students are required to have a certain level of fluency in English before they can instruct in Pennsylvania, as required by the English Fluency in Higher Ed ucation Act of 1990. Through this Act, all institutions of higher educatio n in the state are required to ev aluate and certify the English fluency of all instructional personnel, includ ing teaching assistants and interns. The full university policy can be reviewed at: https://www.cmu.edu/polic ies/faculty/evaluation-certification-english-fluency-instructors.html . 11.4.4 Leave of Absence The LTI discourages Leaves of Absence (LOA) since students usually do not return, despite having good intentions. However, a student in good standing may be granted a LOA of at most one year, upon written request to the MSAII Dire ctor and with the consent of the student's advisor. It is the responsibility of the student on LOA to contact th e LTI to initiate a return to the program. Students taking or returning from a leave of absence must follow the university\u2019s leave of absence process, which is described at www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/student-leave.html", "29 11.4.5 Satisfactory Progress If a student does not make satisfactory progress each se mester toward completing the degree, the LTI may remove the student from the program. See section on \u201cEnd of Semester Evaluation.\u201d 11.5 Carnegie Mellon Academic Policies 11.5.1 Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities The Office of Disability Resources at Carneg ie Mellon University has a continued mission to provide physical and programmatic campus access to all events and information within the Carnegie Mellon community. We work to ensure that qualified individuals receive reasonable accommodations as guaranteed by the Americans wi th Disabilities Act (ADA) and Sections 503 and 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. St udents who would like to receive accommodations must submit a Voluntary Disclosure of Disability Form to access@andrew.cmu.edu to begin the interactive accommodation process. For more information, please see https://www.cmu.edu/disability-resources/ .Students with physical, sensory, cognitive, or emotional disabilities are enco uraged to self-identify with the Office of Disability Resources and request needed accommodation s. Any questions about the process can be directed to access@andr ew.cmu.edu, or call (412) 268-6121. 11.5.2 Summary of Graduate Student A ppeal and Grievance Procedures Students who believe that they ha ve been inappropriately treated are encouraged to raise their concern(s) with the Program Director, department head, or other designa ted person in their department, college, or central administration accord ing to University policies. No effort will be made to prevent or discourage anyone from availing themselves of such procedures (see Graduate Student Appeal and Procedures www.cmu.edu/graduate/poli cies/appeal-grievance-procedures.html ). Graduate students will find the Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures on the Graduate Education Reso urce web page. This document summarizes processes available to graduate students who se ek review of academic and non-academic issues. Graduate students are expected to seek informal resolution of all concerns within the applicable department, unit or program before invoking fo rmal processes. When an informal resolution cannot be reached, however, a gr aduate student who seeks furthe r review of the matter is to follow the formal procedures outlined here. Th ese appeal and grievanc e procedures shall apply to students in all graduate programs of the Univ ersity. Students should refer to the department specific information in this handbook for dep artment and college information about the administration and academic policies of the prog ram. Additionally, students may confer with", "30 the Graduate Education Office ( grad-ed@cmu.edu ) on issues of process or other concerns as they navigate conflicts. 11.5.3 Process for Appealing Final Grades https://www.cmu.edu/graduate/policies /appeal-grievance-procedures.html . Final grades will be changed only in exceptiona l circumstances and only with the approval of the instructor and the department, unit or prog ram. Grading is a matter of sound discretion of the instructor and final grades are rarely ch anged without the consent of the instructor who assigned the grade. The following circumstances are the unusual exceptions that may warrant a grade appeal: (a) the final grade assigned for a cours e is based on manifest error (e.g. a clear error such as arithmetic error in computing a grade or failure to grade one of the answers on an exam), or (b) the faculty or staff member who assigned the grade did so in violation of a University policy 11.5.4 Safeguarding Educational Equity: Policy Against Sexual Harassment and Sexual Assault The University prohibits sex-based discriminati on, sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating/ domestic violence and stalking. The University al so prohibits retaliation against individuals who bring forward such concerns or allegation s in good faith. The University\u2019s Sexual Misconduct Policy is available at www.cmu.edu/policies/administrative-and-governance/sexual-harassment-and-sexual-assault.html . If you believe you have been the victim of sexual harassment or sexual assault, you ar e encouraged to make contact with any of the following resources: \uf0b7 Office of Title IX Initiatives, http://www.cmu.edu/title-ix/ , 412-268-7125 \uf0b7 Sexual Harassment Advisors, found in A ppendix A of the Policy Against Sexual Harassment and Sexual Assault; \uf0b7 Survivor Support Network, found in A ppendix B of the Policy Against Sexual Harassment and Sexual Assault; \uf0b7 Sexual Harassment Process and Title IX Coordina tors, found in section II of the Policy Against Sexual Harassment and Sexual Assault; \uf0b7 University Police, 412-268-2323 \uf0b7 University Health Services, 412-268-2157 \uf0b7 Counseling & Psychological Services, 412-268-2922", "31 Additional resources and information can be found at : https://www.cmu.edu/title-ix/resources-and-information/resources.html . The University\u2019s Policy Against Retaliation is available at https://www.cmu.edu/policies/administrati ve-and-governance/whistleblower.html The MSAII program has a ZERO TOLERANCE policy on sexual harassment and sexual assault. If you are found to have violated Carnegie Mell on policy, you will be dropped from the MSAII program immediately without exception . CMU has spent decades successfully developing a non-threatening environment for all genders and no one will be permitted to interfere with that accomplishment. Consensual Intimate Relationship Poli cy Regarding Undergraduate Students https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-s tudent-life/consensual-relationships.html This policy is relevant for graduate students who will be in a supervisory role of undergraduate students as a TA or in a research lab/studio se tting. This policy addresses the circumstances in which romantic, sexual or amorous relationships/ interactions with undergraduate students, even if consensual, are inappropriate and prohib ited. The purpose of this policy is to assure healthy professional relationships. This policy is not intended to discoura ge consensual intimate relationships unless there is a conflicting profe ssional relationship in which one party has authority over the other as in the policy. 11.5.5 Cultural Tolerance The MSAII program is extremely diverse for a pr ogram of its size. We have students from numerous different countries who must work effectively in a team se tting. The students invariably come from very different cultures that have differing attitudes towards age, gender, and group interaction. The program management understands this, but th e students must also recognize that this program is being conducted in the United States and operates according to U.S. norms. Students and faculty, regardless of background, age, or rank, must deal with each other respectfully without insult or raised voices . It is impossible to conduct teamwork in any other way. Violations will be dealt with harshly. The Program Director is not sympathetic to such behavior, which will not be tolerated. Re peated infractions, or a serious single infraction may result in termination from the program. 11.5.6 Language Policy The MSAII program is a component of the Language Technologies Institute, which studies and celebrates the diversity of human language and fo rms of expression. The LTI also recognizes the futility and unfairness of attempting to det ermine the language students must use when communicating. However, it is unprofessional in any official team meeting to speak a language", "32 that is not understood by all team members. Fo r example, if all members of a team understand Chinese, then they may use Chi nese in team meetings. However, if even one team member does not understand Chinese, then a language must be us ed that is understood by all team members. It is recommended that non-native speakers of Eng lish use English as much as possible if they intend to seek employment in an English-speaking country. 11.5.7 Childbirth/Maternity Accommodation Protocol The Maternity Policy is available at https://www.cmu.edu/graduate/programs-services/maternity-accommodation-protocol.html . Students whose anticipated delivery date is duri ng the course of the semester may consider taking time away from their coursework and re search responsibilities. All female students who give birth to a child while engaged in coursework or research are eligible to take either a short-term absence or formal leave of absence. St udents in course work should consider either working with their course instructor to receive in complete grades or elect to drop to part-time status or to take a semester leave of absence. Students engaged in research must work with their faculty to develop plans for the re search for the time they are away. \u25cf Students must contact the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs to register for Maternity Accommodations. Students will complete an info rmation form and meet with a member of the Dean\u2019s Office staff to determine resources and procedures appropriate for the individual student. \u25cb Planning for the student\u2019s discussio n with appropriate academic contact(s) (advisor, associate dean, etc.) may be reviewed during this meeting. \u25cf Students in course work should consider op tions for the semester of the anticipated birth such as working with their course instructo rs to receive incomplete grades, electing to drop to part-time status or taking a full semester leave of absence. \u25cf Students engaged in research must work with their facu lty to develop plans for the research for the time they are aw ay and for resuming upon return. \u25cf Master's students who receive an academ ic stipend funded by Carnegie Mellon are eligible to continue to receive stipend funding for up to six (6) week s during a Short-Term Maternity Accommodation or a Formal Leave of Absence. Continued academic stipend funding may be extended by two (2) weeks, for a total of eight (8) weeks, if an absence longer than six weeks is medically necessary. To receive this supp ort students must be registered with the Office of the Dean of Students. Students are encouraged to consult with relevant university facu lty and staff as soon as possible as they begin making plans regarding time away. Students must contact the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs to register for Maternity Accommodations. Students will complete an information form and meet with a member of De an\u2019s Office staff to determine resources and", "33 procedures appropriate for the i ndividual student. Planning fo r the student\u2019s discussion with her academic contact(s) (advisor, associate dean, etc.) will be reviewed during this meeting. 11.6 Statute of Limitations As outlined in the Master\u2019s Students Statute of Limitations, www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of-limitations.html , students must complete all requirements for the master\u2019s degree within a maximum of seven years from original matriculation as a master\u2019s student, or less if re quired by a more restrictive department, school or college policy. Once this time-to-degree li mit has lapsed, the person may resume work towards a master\u2019s degree only if newly admitted to a currently offered master\u2019s degree program under criteria determined by that program. Under extraordinary circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, family or parental leave, or temporary disability, a school or college may, upon the relevant department's recommendation and with the written approval of the dean (or designate), defer the lapse for a period commensurate with the duration of that interruption. Students who are pursuing a master\u2019s degree as part-time students for all seme sters of their program, as approved by their program, may also appeal to their program or department for extension of the time to degree limit. Any request for a waiver of the statute of limita tions must be approved by the Department Head and by the SCS Associate Dean for Masters Programs. The waiver request must explain the exceptional circumstances that wa rrant an extension. For cases in which a waiver is granted, the waiver will cover specific courses and will specify a time period for completion of the program. See also the \u2018Duration of Study\u2019 policy. 11.7 Residency Requirement The MSAII is a full-time, in-resid ence program conducted only on the Pittsburgh campus. In exceptional circumstances, such as visa compli cations or medical exigencies, permission may be granted by the Director allowing a student to participate in short portions of the program remotely. This is not possible for first-year students. 12 Financial Issues 12.1 Graduate Student Funding", "34 The LTI does not provide financial aid or support to students in the professional MS programs.
