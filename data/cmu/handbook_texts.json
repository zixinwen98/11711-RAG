Graduate Student Handbook  Page 9 \n 1  Introduction  \nWelcome to the Language Technologies Institute, a graduate department in the School of \nComputer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. You have joined a Ph.D. program that focuses on excellence, creativity, and training the next generation of research leaders. While the next few \nyears will be a time of hard work and intense concentration, we hope that your time at the LTI \nwill also be rewarding professionally and personally.  \nObtaining a Ph.D. is a long and often intense journey. A healthy work -life balance helps to keep it \nin perspective. Carnegie Mellon  is located in Pittsburgh, a city with a rich industrial and labor \nheritage. In the past, it was the heart of the U.S. steel industry, a source  for quality packaged foods, \nan important financial hub, and an early pioneer in railroads, radio, and nuclear power. This is a \ncity where people worked hard and made things that changed the world. Today, Pittsburgh has \nreinvented itself as a leader in Computer Science and medicine, but it is still a place where people \nwork hard and make things that change the world . It is also an informal city, where people don\u2019t \ntake themselves too seriously and remember to have fun. It is home to excellent museums, competitive professional sports teams, inexpensive magic shows, and free music during the \nsummer, with skiing and magnificent  state parks nearby. Your stay here will be more rewarding \nif you make time for e xploring  the many activities that Pittsburgh and Southwest Pennsylvania \nhave to offer. \nThere are significant differences between CMU's different departments and degree programs in \nphilosophical approach, procedures, policies, and regulations. Each department issues a \nhandbook that informs graduate students of their program requirements and procedures and \nensures that students have written access to standard information. This handbook describes the \npolicies, procedures, and requirements for the Ph.D.  in Language and Information Technologies.  \nAll policies not explicitly described in this document conform to School of Computer Science (SCS) policies and university policies. For information about Carnegie Mellon requirements and policies, please see the university\u2019s handbook The Word\n, the Office of Graduate and Postdoctoral \nAffairs web page , the Office of the Dean of Students web page , and other resources contained in \nAppendix A of this handbook.  \nWelcome! We hope that your time here is a life -changing experience.  \n1.1 Degrees Offered  \nThe Language Technologies Institute offers two Ph.D. programs and four Master degrees.  \n\u2022 Ph.D.  in Language and Information Technologies (LTI Ph.D. ) \n\u2022 Dual -Degree Ph.D. in Language and Information Technologies (CMU -PT Ph.D.)  \n\u2022 Masters in Language Technologies (MLT)  \n\u2022 Master of Science in Intelligent Information Systems (MIIS)  \n\u2022 Master of Computational Data Science  (MCDS)  \n\u2022 Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence and Innovation  (MSAII)  ", "LTI Ph.D.  Graduate Student Handbook  Page 10 \n This handbook applies to the LTI Ph.D.  \nThe Ph.D.  in Language and Information Technologies (LTI Ph.D. ) is focused on understanding \nand extending the state of the art in computational linguistics, natural language processing, \ndialogue systems, information retrieval, machine translation, speech processing,  video \nunderstanding, multimodal systems, automated reasoning, and other topics related to analysis \nand understanding of unstructured information  (e.g., machine learning, and software engineering \nof intelligent systems).  \n1.2 Department Personnel \nThe people responsible for administering the LTI Ph.D.  degree are:  \nJamie Callan  \nPh.D. Program Director  \nProfessor  \nGHC 5419 \ncallan@cs.cmu.edu  \n412-268-4525  Stacey Young  \nPh.D. Academic Program Manager  \nLTI Graduate Program Manager  \nGHC 6415  \nstaceyy@cs.cmu.edu   \n412-268-2623  \nMona Diab  \nLTI Director  \nProfessor  \nGHC 5723 \nmdiab@andrew.cmu.edu  \n412-268-3669  \n \nJoan Axelson  \nOffice Manager  \nGHC 5405  \njaxelson@andrew.cmu.edu  \n412-268-7517  \n Julie Nys  \nEmployment Processes Manger  \nGHC 5405  \njnys@andrew.cmu.edu  \n412-268-3515  \n1.3 University Policies and Expectations \nIt is the responsibility of each member of the Carnegie Mellon community to be familiar with university policies and guidelines. In addition to this departmental graduate student handbook, the following resources are available to assist you in understanding community expectations. \n\u2022 The Word/Student Handbook:  \nhttps://www.cmu.edu/student-a ffairs/theword//index.html\n \n\u2022 Academic Integrity Policy:   \nhttps:// www.cmu.edu/policies/student -and- student -life/academic-\nintegrity.html ", "LTI Ph.D.  Graduate Student Handbook  Page 11 \n \u2022 University Policies Website:   \nhttps://www.cmu.edu/policies/  \n\u2022 Office of Graduate and Postdoctoral Affairs:  \nhttps://www.cmu.edu/graduate/policies/index.html  \nDue to the changing nature of conditions and expectations surrounding public health and safety \nrequirements please visit https:// www.cmu.edu/coronavirus/  for the most up to date information.\n Please see Appendix A for additional information about The Word and University \nresources. \n1.4 The Academic Calendar  \nThe Academic calendar can be found at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/calendar/index.html  and \nprovides information on all deadlines, including registration dates, class start dates, add/drop deadlines, exam dates, and more.   \nSome doctoral course -sections follow a separate Academic Calendar . \n1.5 Carnegie Mellon University Statement of Assurance  \nCarnegie Mellon University does not discriminate in admission, employment, or administration \nof its programs or activities on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, handicap or disability, \nage, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic information.  Furthermore, Carnegie Mellon University does not discriminate and is required not \nto discriminate in violation of federal, state, or local laws or executive orders.  \nInquiries concerning the application of a compliance with this statement should be directed to \nthe university ombuds person , Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA \n15213 (412 -268-1018). Obtain general information about Carnegie Mellon University by calling \n412-268-2000.  \nCarnegie Mellon University publishes an annual campus security and fire safety report describing \nthe university\u2019s security, alcohol and drug, sexual assault,  and fire safety policies, and containing \nstatistics about the number and type of crimes committed on campus, and the number and cause of fires in campus residence facilities during the preceding three years. You can obtain a copy by contacting the Carnegie Mellon Police Department at 412 -268-2323. The annual security and fire \nsafety report also is available online at www.cmu.edu/police/annualreports\n . \nInformation regarding the applicable grievance procedures for alleged violations \nof the Statement of Assurance is available at \nhttps://www.cmu.edu/policies/forms -and-documents/soa- violations.pdf .   \nThe Office for Institutional Equity and Title IX may be reached at 412 -268-7125  ", "LTI Ph.D.  Graduate Student Handbook  Page 12 \n or  institutionalequity@cmu.edu . \n1.6 The Carnegie Mellon Code \nStudents at Carnegie Mellon, because they are members of an academic community dedicated to \nthe achievement of excellence, are expected to meet the highest standards of personal, ethical,  and \nmoral conduct possible.  \n These standards require personal integrity, a commitment to honesty without compromise, as \nwell as truth without equivocation and a willingness to place the good of the community above the good of the self. Obligations once undertaken must be met, commitments kept.  \n As members of the Carnegie Mellon community, individuals are expected to uphold the standards of the community in addition to holding others accountable for said standards. It is rare that the \nlife of a student in an academic community can be so private that it will not affect the community \nas a whole or that the above standards do not apply.  \nThe discovery, advancement and communication of knowledge are not possible without a commitment to these standards. Creativity cannot exist without acknowledgment of the creativity of  others. New knowledge cannot be developed without credit for prior knowledge. \nWithout the ability to trust that these principles will be observed, an academic community cannot exist.  \nThe commitment of its faculty, staff and students to these standards con tributes to the high \nrespect in which the Carnegie Mellon degree is held. Students must not destroy that respect by \ntheir failure to meet these standards. Students who cannot meet them should voluntarily \nwithdraw from the university.  \nThe Carnegie Mellon C ode can also be found here: \nhttps://www.cmu.edu/student-\naffairs/theword/ . \n2 The Language Technologies Institute  \n2.1 Pittsburgh Campus Location  \nThe Language Technologies Institute is located primarily on the 5th and 6th floors of the  Gates \nHillman Complex (GHC) on Carnegie Mellon\u2019s Pittsburgh campus.  The address and contact \ninformation of the LTI are  shown below.  \nLanguage Technologies Institute  \nCarnegie Mellon University  \n5000 Forbes Avenue  \nGates Hillman Complex  \nPittsburgh, PA 15241 -3891  ", "LTI Ph.D.  Graduate Student Handbook  Page 13 \n 412-268-6298 (fax)  \nhttp://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/   \n \nOffice locations for faculty, staff, and Ph.D. students can be found on the LTI website.  \n2.2 Office Space \nMost Ph.D. students in residence on the Pittsburgh campus are given an office in which to study \nand do research. Typically, offices are shared with other Ph.D. students, but they may also be shared with staff, visitors, or other members of the LTI. \nOffices are assigned by the LTI\u2019s Office Manager (see Section 1.2 , Department Personnel, for \ncontact information).  \n2.3 Mailboxes and Office Supplies  \nMailboxes and office supplies are in GHC 5404.  \n2.4 Photocopies and Printers  \nPrinters and photocopies are available to LTI students. The use of a photocopier or printer \nrequires you to log in with your CMU ID card. LTI students may use printers/photocopiers \nscattered throughout the School of Computer Science buildings , but the machines in GHC 5404 \nand GHC 6604  are the most convenient . The SCS Computing Facilities  publishes a list of printers \nonline at https://computing.cs.cmu.edu/desktop/printer -list. \n2.5 Computers for LTI Ph.D.  Students  \nPh.D. students are responsible for having their own laptop computers to support their education \nand research. Students are free to choose their own operating system (e.g., Linux, MacOs, \nWindows).  \nMany Ph.D. advisors also provide access to computer clusters, cloud computing, or other resources to support computationally -intense research.  \nPh.D. students are given access to the LTI\u2019s computer cluster on an as- needed basis, to be used for \ncourse assignments, directed study projects, and/or capstone projects.  The LTI cluster provides \nstorage and computation for projects involving large datasets and/or lengthy computation.  \nPh.D. students receive two types of user ids: An Andrew id and a CS id. All CMU students have \nan Andrew id. Computer Science students also have a CS id that provides access to SCS -specific \nresources (e.g., computer clusters). CS ids are being phased out very slowly, so it is likely that you will need both types of user id.

It can be contacted at \nhelp@cs.cmu.edu  , extension 8 -4231 from a campus phone, or 412 -268-4231 from an outside line  \n(M- F, 9am- 5pm) . \n3 Standard Degree Requirements & Degree Certification                                        \n3.1 LTI Ph.D. Degree Requirements  \nTo complete the Ph.D.  in Language and Information Technologies degree, the student must satisfy \nthe following requirements:  \n\u2022 Pass at least 96  units of graduate level courses, with additional requirements detailed \nbelow ; \n\u2022 Satisfy proficiencies in Writing, Presentation, Programming, and Teaching ; \n\u2022 Propose , write, and defend a Ph.D.  dissertation (thesis) ; \n\u2022 Attend the LTI Colloquium (11 -700) each semester ; and \n\u2022 Satisfy the Research Speaking Requirement.   \nThe sections below provide more detail about each of these requirements.  \n3.1.1 Course Requirements  \nTo complete the course requirements for the Ph.D. in Language and Information Technologies \ndegree, the student must pass 96  or more course units of graduate courses, and meet the following \ncriteria:  \n\u2022 At least 72 units of \u201cLTI\u201d courses and 24  units of \u201cSCS\u201d courses, \n\u2022 At least one class in each \u201cLTI Focus Area\u201d, and  \n\u2022 At least two labs, in two different research areas . \nFor definitions of quoted terms, see the section on \u201cDefinitions of LTI Terminology\u201d.  \nUnless approved by the Program Director in advance, the course requirements must be satisfied \nby actual classroom courses, not credit given for research or independent study.  \nAn \u201cLTI course \u201d is any 12 -unit course with a number of 11 -XXX; a  6-unit course with 11 -XXX \ncounts as one- half of an LTI course. Unless otherwise specified, \"course\" means an actual \nclassroom course, not  credit given for research or independent study. Note that the LTI  allow s \nany one MLD (10 -XXX) graduate course to count as an \"LTI course\".  \nAn \u201cSCS course\u201d is any 12 -unit course with a course number indicating a unit of the School of \nComputer Science (including LTI); a 6 -unit course with such a number counts as one -half of an \nSCS course. Unless otherwise specified, \"course\" means an actual classroom course, not credit given for research or independent study. Note: Recommended electives that are technically  ", "LTI Ph.D.  Graduate Student Handbook  Page 15 \n outside of the SCS now count towards this requirement; for example, Digital Signal Processing in \nECE. Please see the Program Director for approval of electives as \u201cSCS.\u201d  \n\u201cLTI Focus Areas\u201d are sets of courses defined on the LTI course webpage under \u201cCourse Categories.\u201d If a student believes a new course should be added to a Focus Area, they should make a request to  the Ph.D. Program Director . They  will decide, with advice from faculty in the \nappropriate area, whether it should be in the Focus Area. I f approved , it will be added to the LTI \nFocus Area webpage.  \nA \u201cTask -Orientation Focus Course \u201d is a course belonging to that LTI Focus Area, as listed on \nthe LTI\u2019s \u201cCourse Categories\u201d webpage.  \nAn LTI \u201c lab course \u201d is a course in the list of lab courses defined o n the LTI \u2019s \u201cCourse Categories\u201d \nwebpage . \n3.1.2 Grade Requirements  \nStudents must demonstrate their mastery of material taught in courses and their success in applying their skills in directed stu dy by satisfying the following grade requirements . \nMinimum grade:  Only courses with a grade of B (3.0) or higher are counted as satisfying a degree \nrequirement. \nPass/fail:  Pass/fail grades are not permitted for courses and projects used to satisfy a degree  \nrequirement. \n3.1.3 Proficiency Requirements  \nThe LTI Ph.D.  does not require any Qualifying Exams.  Instead, a LTI Ph.D.  student is required to \ndemonstrate proficiency in the following four areas.  \n\u2022 Writing: This is satisfied by producing a peer -reviewed conference paper, or the \nequivalent (a written report that at least two SCS faculty certify as being of conference -\npaper quality).  \n \n\u2022 Presentation: This is satisfied by the oral presentation of a conference paper, or the \nequivalent (an oral presentation that at least t wo SCS faculty certify as being of \nconference- talk quality).  \n \n\u2022 Programming:  This is satisfied by demonstrating competence in computer programming \nof language technology; this is normally satisfied in the course of the student's research \nand/or project work.  \n ", "LTI Ph.D.  Graduate Student Handbook  Page 16 \n \u2022 Teaching:  This is satisfied by two (2) successful Teaching Assistantships ( TA-ships), as \ndetermined by the faculty member for whom the student serves as TA . Typically,  one of \nthese will be for an undergraduate class, and one for a graduate -level class. O ne of the two \nTA-ships may be in some form of pre -approved \"alternate service\", such as an SCS \u201cv -unit .\u201d  \n \nThe Program Coordinator must be notified in advance of a TA-ship,  or it may not be accepted .  \nGraduate students are required to have a certain level of fluency in English before they can instruct in Pennsylvania, as required by the English Fluency in Higher Education Act of 1990. Through this \nAct, all institutions of higher education in the state are required to evaluate and certify the English \nfluency of all instructional personnel, including teaching assistants and interns. The full university policy can be reviewed at:  \nhttps://www.cmu.edu/policies/faculty/evaluation -certification -english -fluency -instructors.html\n \nThe fluency of all instructional personnel will be rated  by Language Support in the Student \nAcademic Success Center to determine at what level of responsibility the student can TA.  \nIn addition to administering the International Teaching Assistant (ITA) Test (a mandatory \nscreening test for any non- native speake r of English), Language Support in the Student Academic \nSuccess Center helps teaching assistants who are non -native English speakers develop fluency \nand cultural understanding to teach successfully at Carnegie Mellon. Visit the Student Academic Success Center website for additional information:  \nhttps://www.cmu.edu/student- success/\n \n3.1.4 The Ph.D. Dissertation  \nThe Ph.D.  dissertation is the defining feature of a Ph.D.  degree. The process of completing a Ph.D. \ndissertation has three important milestones. \n\u2022 Thesis Topic : During the Ph.D.  student\u2019s third year, the student should be working hard \nto find a thesis topic. The thesis topic typically develops from the directed research that \nthe student has been carrying out with the student\u2019s advisor.  The topic is a well- defined \nresearch proble m that is interesting and unsolved, and for which the student has a \nbelievable proposed solution.  When the dissertation is finished, there will be a \u201cthesis \nstatement\u201d that describes the claimed solution to the research problem that is the thesis \ntopic.  \n \n\u2022 Thesis Proposal:  Near the end of the student\u2019s third year, the student will compose a \ndissertation proposal. In this document, the student will specify the problem the research addresses (the thesis topic); the significance of the problem and expected scie ntific \ncontributions; other relevant research, including competing approaches; some preliminary results; the work that still must be completed; evaluation metrics for that work; and a ", "LTI Ph.D.  Graduate Student Handbook  Page 17 \n projected timeline for completion. Before presenting the proposal, the student will also \nsecure approval for a dissertation committee, which consists of the student\u2019s advisor, at least two other SCS faculty members working in language technologies, and at least one external member.  \n University rules require that the time and place of the proposal presentation be publicly announced at least one week before the presentation. The student should coordinate this with the Ph.D.  Program Coordinator. The public thesis proposal protects the student by \nguaranteeing that the proposed research is interesting to the larger scientific community and demonstrating that the student will finish the program if the work is completed as outlined.  \n \n\u2022 Thesis Defense:  The dissertation document itself, normally expected at the end of the fifth \nyear, will include a detailed description of all the work done, including a clear evaluation \nand a discussion of its scientific contributions. There are no fixed style or document length guidelines or requirements; the only format requirement is that the title page should be suitable to be issued as an LTI Technical Report. The dissertation defense is a public \npresentation and defense of the dissertation results.  \n \nNote: University rules again require that the time and place of the dissertation defense be publicly an nounced at least one week prior to the defense. This should also be coordinated \nwith Ph.D.  Program Coordinator.   \n Note: At the time of the public announcement, a draft of the thesis document must be \nmade available online.  \n3.1.5 Research Speaking Requirement  \nTo emphasize student research, improve public speaking skills and increase internal awareness of LTI work, all LTI Ph.D.  students must complete an oral presentation at the LTI each year (by \nthe end of May). The presentation should consist of a 20- minute ta lk plus time for discussion. It \nmust be advertised to the LTI mailing lists at least one week before your presentation, and the public will be invited. (The thesis proposal and defense each count towards this requirement.)  \nAt least two LTI faculty members will attend the presentation, including the research advisor. \nAfter the presentation, these faculty members will convene and provide written feedback to both the student and the Program Director  of graduate programs (the form for this is available on the \nLTI website). This feedback will help the student refine speaking skills with respect to talk \nstructure, content,  and delivery.  \n3.2 Advising  \nEach student has a faculty advisor charged with guiding the education and monitoring the \nprogress of the student through the program. The advisor also supervises the student's directed ", "LTI Ph.D.  Graduate Student Handbook  Page 18 \n study projects. This personal student -advisor relationship ensures that every student receives the \nnecessary faculty mentoring. The advisor also provides the student with career advice.  \nHow a nd when the advisor is selected  (The Matching  Process) : Advisors are selected during \nthe first month of the program. Students are expected to attend the LTI's Orientation lectures,  \n(Section 3.3) in which faculty describe their interests and areas of expertise, and to be proactive \nabout meeting individually with potential advisors. After meeting with several potential advisors, \neach student will be asked to indicate a first, second and third choice for advisor. Meanwhile,  the \npotential advisors determine how many new students they can take and  indicate their \npreferences. Finally, the entire LTI faculty meets as a \" Matching  Committee\" to determine the best \nset of matches.  \nUntil a student finds a specific advisor, the Progr am Director  of the LTI graduate programs serves \nas the advisor.  \nHow to change advisors:  The initial advisor selection should be made carefully. However, it is \npossible to change advisors. To do so, the student should find another faculty member willing to \nserve as an advisor, and then make a request to the Program Director to switch advisors. The LTI \nfollows the long- standing SCS policy that both the new and old advisors need to agree to the \nchange; typically, this is not a problem (assuming the new advisor  has agreed in advance, as \ndescribed here). It is to the student's advantage to avoid switching advisors, especially late in their graduate studies, because forging a strong student -advisor relationship takes time.  \n3.3 LTI Orientation  \nAt the beginning of each Fall semester, the LTI provides 2 -3 weeks of lectures and talks to help \nstudents learn about the work done by CMU faculty and to provide an opportunity for advisors to recruit new students. Students are expected to attend them and treat them as seriously a s a \nstandard course, because they provide a good introduction to the broad range of research done at \nthe LTI. Students do not register for the LTI Orientation, nor do they receive a grade; however, the department is serious about its expectation that new students will attend these talks.  \nFor many years, these talks were called \"the Immigration Course (IC).\" The intuition behind this \nname is that the talks help orient newly -arrived students \u2013 immigrants into the CMU \nenvironment. As a result, some students u nderstood the name to indicate that the talks would be \nabout US immigration and visa requirements. The older name has been retired; however, people who have been at CMU a long time may occasionally use the older name . \n3.4 End of Semester Evaluation  \nNear the e nd of each semester, the student must prepare a statement that describes his or her \nachievements in the current semester and plans for the next semester.  \nAt the end of the semester, the faculty evaluates each student's academic progress. The student's \nadvisor serves as the student's advocate in this process. The result of the evaluation is a letter from ", "LTI Ph.D.  Graduate Student Handbook  Page 19 \n the faculty to the student that indicates whether the student is making satisfactory progress \ntowards completing the degree.  \nA good letter typically indicates that the student is making satisfactory progress. If the student is doing exceptionally good work, a stronger adjective such as excellent might be used, but this is unusual.  \nIf a student seems to be having trouble, the faculty determines whether it believes that the student \ncan finish the degree, and if so, what needs to be accomplished to get back on track. This type of \nletter should be considered a serious warning. It is not a permanent \"black mark\" on the student's record; if the student begins makin g satisfactory progress again, there is no official record of the \nletter in the student's transcript. \nIn the most serious cases, the faculty gives the student an \u201cN -1\u201d letter that specifies a list of \nconditions that the student must satisfy by specific deadlines. Failure to meet all t he specified \nconditions may result in the student's termination from the program.  \n3.5 Electives Outside of SCS  \nStudents may  take elective courses outside the SCS, at Carnegie Mellon or cross -registered at the \nUniversity of Pittsburgh, as long as the student fulfills the requirements of their program as \ndescribed above. The student should discuss any such electives in advance w ith their advisor . \nTypical choices might include ECE courses for Speech students, Pitt Linguistics courses, or \nStatistics courses.  \nStudents interested in taking recommended electives outside the SCS should pay particular \nattention to the following issues. \n\u2022 Recommended electives outside of the SCS count towards the \u201cSCS\u201d course requirement. Please see the Program Director for approval of an elective as an \u201cSCS  course\u201d .  \n\u2022 Students need advance approval for any courses not covered by their normal tuition (e.g.,  \nsummer courses).  \n\u2022 The grading of outside courses is the responsibility of the department offering the course; however, the LTI's Minimum Course Grade Policy described above still applies (\u201cB\u201d is the minimum for Ph.D. ).  \n3.6 Completing a n M.S. Degree Enroute t o a Ph.D. \nCourses that satisfy LTI Ph.D. degree requirements may also be used to satisfy requirements for \none M.S. degree. The most common choice is the LTI\u2019s Master of Language Technologies (MLT) \ndegree because its requirements are similar (but not identical) to the Ph.D. requirements. Other M.S. degrees within the LTI and outside of the LTI are also possible.  ", "LTI Ph.D.  Graduate Student Handbook  Page 20 \n Students interested in an M.S. degree other than the MLT degree should  discuss their plans with \ntheir Ph.D. advisor due to the additional courses and project work that may be involved.  \n3.7 Grading and Evaluation  \n3.7.1 University Policy on Grades  \nCarnegie Mellon\u2019s Grading  policy offers details concerning university grading principles for \nstudents taking courses and covers the specifics of assigning and c hanging grades, grading \noptions, drop/ withdrawals, and course repeats.   It also defines the undergraduate and graduate \ngrading standards.  \nProcess for Appealing Final Grades  \nFinal grades will be changed only in exceptional circumstances and only with the approval of the \ninstructor and the department, unit, or program.  \nGrading is a matter of sound discretion of the instructor and final grades are rarely changed without the consent of the instructor who assigned the grade. The following circumstances are \nthe unusual exceptions that may warrant a grade appeal: (a) the final grade assigned for a course \nis based on manifest error (e.g., a clear error such as arithmetic error in computing a grade or \nfailure to grade one of the answers on an exam), or (b) the faculty or staff member who assigned the grade did so in violation of a university  policy.  \nSee the university\u2019s Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures\n web page \nfor more information.  https://www.cmu.edu/student -affairs/theword/academic/appeal -of-\ngrades -and-academic- actions.html  \n3.7.2 University Policy on Grades for Transfer Courses  \nhttps://www.cmu.edu/policies/student- and-student -life/transfer- credit -\nevaluation -and-assignment.html  \nCarnegie Mellon University offers students the opportunity to take courses for credit through a cross- registration program (see Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE) and Cross-\nregistration below) and through the receipt of transfer credit from othe r accredited institutions. \nThe Carnegie Mellon University transcript will include information on such courses as follows: Carnegie Mellon courses and courses taken through the university's cross -registration program \nwill have grades recorded on the transcr ipt and be factored into the QPA. All other courses will \nbe recorded on this transcript indicating where the course was taken, but without grade. Such courses will not be taken into account for academic actions, honors or QPA calculations.  \n ", "LTI Ph.D.  Graduate Student Handbook  Page 21 \n 3.8 Academic Integrity  \nIn the midst of self- exploration, the high demands of a challenging academic environment can \ncreate situations where some students have difficulty exercising good judgment. Academic \nchallenges can provide many opportunities for high standards to evolv e if students actively reflect \non these challenges and if the community supports discussions to aid in this process. It is the \nresponsibility of the entire community to establish and maintain the integrity of our university.  \nCarnegie Mellon University edu cates its students to become professionals who will serve society \nwith integrity. The university also creates and disseminates new knowledge and expressions of \nknowledge in ways that benefit society.  \nCarnegie Mellon strives to serve the changing needs of society through the three primary goals outlined in its mission statement: T o create and disseminate knowledge and art through research \nand artistic expression, teaching and learning and transfer to society; to serve students by teaching them leadership, problem- solving skills, and the values of quality, ethical behavior, \nresponsibility to society and commitments to work; and to pursue the advantages provided by a \ndiverse community, open to the exchange of ideas, where discovery and artistic creativity can  \nflourish.  \nIn any presentation, creative, artistic or research, it is the ethical responsibility of each student to \nidentify the conceptual sources of the work submitted. Failure to do so is dishonest and is the basis for a charge of cheating or plagiarism, which is subject to disciplinary action.  \nPlease review the University Policy on Academic Integrity\n. \nThe policy includes the University expectations around academic integrity and provides \ndefinitions of cheating, plagiarism, and unauthorized assistance.  \nA review of the University\u2019s Academic Disciplinary Actions  procedures is also recommended.  \nImportant note: The LTI implements the above policy\u2019s option of \u201cconven[ing] a disciplinary \nhearing according to the procedures of the department/program.\u201d Our procedure is as follows: A first violation is grounds for dismissal from the graduate program. If we decide not to immediately dismiss, the first violation will result in the student being on disciplinary probation.  \nIf the student commits a second violation while on probation, the penalty is dismissal from the \ngraduate program. \nThese procedures outline the process for investigating, reporting, and adjudicating violations of \nthe University Policy on Academic Integrity. The procedures also outline the appeal process.  \nPlease see the Appeals of Course Level Action section  of The Word and the \nOffice of Community \nStandards & Integrity w eb page for more information.  ", "LTI Ph.D.  Graduate Student Handbook  Page 22 \n 3.9 Withdrawal of a Degree \nThe University reserves the right to withdraw a degree even though it has been granted should \nthere be discovery that the work upon which it was based or the academic records in support of it had been falsified. In such a case, withdrawal of the degree will occur promptly upon discovery of the falsification. See the university\u2019s Withdrawal of a Degree\n policy for more information.  \n3.10 Employment Eligibility Verification  \nIf you are receiving a stipend, are a TA, or are planning to have a position with CMU then Employment Eligibility Verification is required. Form I -9 must be completed within 3 business \ndays of beginning work for any type of compensation (stipend or employment). Additional details are highlighted below. To ensure compliance with federal law, Carnegie Mellon University \nmaintains the Employment Eligibility Verification (I- 9) Policy [pdf] covering the university\u2019s \nI-9 and E -Verify requirements : \n\u2022 Every individual receiving a stipend from CMU or employed by CMU must comply with \nthe I -9 Policy by completing the Form I -9 within three business days following the first \nday of stipend start date/employment.  \n\u2022 Individuals who expect to work on a federally  funded project are further responsible for \nsubmitting an E -Verify Processing Request Form to the Office of Human Resources if \nrequired.  \n\u2022 For more information, please see CMU\u2019s Guidance for Completing the Form I -9 and E -\nVerify Requirements at CMU [pdf] , or visit the Human Resources Service website to \nlearn more about Form I -9 and E -Verify and to schedule an appointment to complete the \nForm I -9. \n\u2022 Students who fail to complete the Form I -9 in a timely manner may have stipend payments \nsuspended.   If employed by the university, an individual who fails to timely complete the \nForm I -9 may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of \nemployment.  \nFor more information : \n\u2022 See CMU\u2019s Guidance for Completing the Form I -9 and E -Verify Requirements at CMU , \nor \n\u2022 Visit the Human Resources Service website to learn more about Form I -9 and E -Verify  \nand to schedule an appointment to complete the Form I -9.\u201d \n3.11 Additional Guidance for Students  ", "LTI Ph.D.  Graduate Student Handbook  Page 23 \n 3.11.1 Program of Study   \nStudents seeking guidance about their program of study and degree requirements should consult \nwith their academic advisor and/or appropriate associate dean.  \n3.11.2  Financial Aid and Student Account   \nStudents are expected to make normal progress toward their degree in order to graduate within the standard timeframe for their program of study. Under U.S. Federal Title IV regulations, student eligibility for federal financial aid is contingent upon enrollment in and successful completion of courses that are counted as credit toward their current degree program. To receive the maximum amount of federal financial aid for which they may be eligible, students must enroll each se mester in at least 36 units that count toward their current degree level. (See separate \nguidance regarding integrated degree completion.)   \nStudents should consult with their designated college liaison in The HUB regarding billing and financial aid, particu larly for early completion, longer -than -standard completion, or integrated \nundergraduate and master\u2019s degree programs.    \n3.11.3  International Students  \nImmigration status for students in F- 1 and J- 1 non -immigrant status is tied to making normal \nprogress toward completing degree requirements. Therefore, F -1 and J -1 students who are \nconsidering completing their degree requirements early, anticipating longer -than -standard \ncompletion, or moving from an undergraduate to a graduate student classification (integ rated \nundergraduate -graduate study) should consult with their designated advisor in the Office of \nInternational Education (OIE) to ensure compliance with immigration regulations.  \n4 Ph.D.  Academic Policies  \n4.1 Duration of Study  \nThe target duration of the LTI Ph.D.  is five years, although six years is also common.  \nCarnegie Mellon graduate students are expected to complete their degree requirements within the standard length of time for their program of study as outlined in this Graduate Student Handbook. Upon completion of the graduate program degree requirements, the degree will be certified by the student\u2019s academic program in the semester in which the student completes the \nrequirements.  \nEarly Completion  \nThe Ph.D. is granted when  all degree requirements are satisfied. Some students complete the \nprogram in fewer than five years.  ", "LTI Ph.D.  Graduate Student Handbook  Page 24 \n Extended or Longer- than -Standard Competition  \nLonger- than -standard degree completion may occur due to academic interruptions in making \nprogress toward the d egree as defined by the academic program, interruptions of full -time study \nor progress towards the degree due to serious, documented medical issues, or other unusual or \nunforeseen circumstances.  \nDoctoral students who require an extended period to complete their degree requirements must consult with their academic program and  are subject to the CMU Policy on Doctoral Student \nStatus (https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student -and-student -life/doctoral -student -status.html), \nspecifically the \u201cTime to Degree. \u201d \n4.1.1 Departm ent Policy on Double Counting Courses  \nAn LTI Ph.D.  student who uses courses taken as a M aster \u2019s degree student (at Carnegie Mellon \nor elsewhere) toward their program requirements cannot use those same courses toward any \nother Master\u2019s degree offered by the school . The LTI (like other SCS units) allows its Ph.D.  \nstudents who have passed the requirements for an LTI Master\u2019s degree to receive the master\u2019s  \ndegree without any additional work. Any other sharing of coursework by an LTI student between \nmore than on e CMU degree (e.g., receiving an MLD Master\u2019s  degree that includes courses taken \nas an LTI Ph.D.  student) must be explicitly approved by the LTI, on a case -by-case basis, in \nadvance.  \n4.1.2 External Internships  \nThe LTI provides summer support for its Ph.D.  students, so Ph.D. students are expected to do \nresearch at Carnegie Mellon during the summer. However, outside experience can be a valuable \neducational experience, Ph.D. students in good standing  are allowed to do an e xternal internship. \nSome  students may  benefit from more than one internship, especially if they require access to \nproprietary data for their work, thus , with the approval of the student\u2019s advisor, a student can intern up \nto four (4) times during their Ph.D. degree. Interning more than four ( 4) times requires approval \nfrom the Ph.D. P rogram Director.  \nAny internship must be planned in consultation with the student\u2019s advisor and the LTI Ph.D.  \nCoordinator. If an internship is part of a fully -funded external fellowship (e.g., Microsoft Research \nFellowship), the student does not need prior LTI approval, but should still coordinate with their \nadvisor. International students must consult with Office of International Education (OIE) for eligibility before seeking an internship or signing an offer contract.  \nInternships are typically scheduled during the summer. In certain cases,  it is possible to schedule \nan internship during the fall or spring semester; the details are complex, especially for international students, so the student should discuss this as early as possible with the Ph.D. \nProgram Director . International students must coordinate carefully with the LTI in any event, due \nto visa restrictions.  ", "LTI Ph.D.  Graduate Student Handbook  Page 25 \n Note that self- funded Ph.D.  students (e.g., those registered for five units while on semester \ninterns hip) are not permitted to receive a partial stipend for the semester of their internship, while \nfull- time LTI -sponsored students are eligible for a partial stipend.  \nAll students are caution ed to be aware of potential intellectual property (IP) problems with \ninternships, and to review any IP agreements with their advisors before signing them. It is possible \nto lose ownership of your ideas.  \nIf the student is to receive academic credit for the internship,  it must have deliverables from the \nstudent commensurate with the number of units,  they are taking. This can be in the form of \ninterim and final reports on the experience, presentations in the following semester regarding the experience, assessments of their experience as it relates to their course of study, etc.  \n4.1.3 Maximum Courseload  \nPh.D.  students are permitted to register for a maximum of 54  units of coursework per semester.  \n4.1.4 Pass/Fail Grades  \nPass/fail grades are not permitted for courses used to satisfy a degree requirement.  \nGraduate students who are required to take additional undergraduate courses to build up the core \nfoundations of computer science may not elect the pass/fail option for th ese courses.  \n4.1.5 Transfer Credit  \nAn equivalent graduate course previously completed at another institution may be permitted to \nsatisfy one of the Ph.D.  course requirements. The decision on whether a course may be transferred \nis made by the Ph.D.  Program Direct or.  \nTypically,  the student will provide the Program Director with the syllabus of the external course, \nand the Program Director will use that and the student\u2019s transcript to make the decision.  \nSee the section on \u201cDefinition of transfer credit versus cour se exemption .\u201d \nA student may not receive transfer credit for more than four courses.  \n4.1.6 Residency Requirements  \nThe university requires Ph.D. s to spend at least one year of residency at Carnegie Mellon.  \nThe SCS requires that all Ph.D.  students must take at Carnegie Mellon a minimum of 48  units of \nthe total coursework required by their respective programs. ", "LTI Ph.D.  Graduate Student Handbook  Page 26 \n 4.1.7 Transferring Into the Ph.D.  Program  \nThe LTI does not allow direct transfers from its master\u2019s programs into its Ph.D.  program . The \nstudent must apply for the Ph.D.  at the usual time . However, students that are already enrolled in \nan LTI degree program are not required to retake GRE and TOEFL exams or to produce new \ntranscripts from other universities.  \n4.1.8 Transferring Out of the Ph.D.  Program  \nThe Ph.D.  program doe s not prevent students from transferring to another degree program . A \nstudent who is interested in transferring out of the Ph.D.  degree program should consult the \nhandbook and Program Director of the desired degree program to learn whether transfers are permitted, and if so, how, and when to request such a transfer.  \n4.2 LTI Academic Policies  \n4.2.1 \u201cGrandfather\u201d Policy  \nA student can graduate under the policies in effect at the time that the student entered the \nprogram; or, at the student's choice, the student can graduate under policies that are adopted after \nthe student entered the program. If it is not realistic to follow a particular policy  exactly, the \ndepartment may approximate the policy as closely as possible; this situation is rare and typically arises only when a student is enrolled in the program for an extended period of time.  \n4.2.2 Definition of Transfer Credit  vs. Course Exemption  \nThe LT I may grant transfer credit  or issue an exemption for equivalent graduate courses previously \ncompleted at another institution. This decision rests with the director  of the particular program.  \nIf a student is exempt  from a required course due to prior cour ses or experience, the student can \nreplace that course with an open elective. The student does not receive credit for the external course but  can take any course that could normally count toward the degree in its place.  \nIf a student receives credit  for pr ior coursework completed at CMU or elsewhere, the student \nreceives that many units of credit, and the total amount of required coursework is reduced by that \namount.  \n4.2.3 External Employment/Consulting  \nStudents funded by LTI research projects are expected to wor k primarily for those projects. Since \nconsulting provides useful experience, students are generally permitted to consult at most one \nday per seven- day week, with the advisor's consent . International students must also have \napproval in advance from the Office of International Education (OIE) ; otherwise, they may be in \nviolation of their visa status. See also External Internships.  ", "LTI Ph.D.  Graduate Student Handbook  Page 27 \n 4.2.4  Leave of Absence  \nThe LTI discourages Leaves of Absence (LOA), since students usually do not return, despite good \nintentions. However, a student in good standing may be granted a LOA of at most 1 year, upon written request to the Ph.D. Program Director and with consent of t he student's advisor. It is the \nresponsibility of the student on LOA to contact the LTI to initiate a return to the program.  \nStudents taking or returning from a leave of absence must follow the university\u2019s \nleave of absence \nprocess.  \n4.2.5 Satisfactory Progress  \nIf a student does not make satisfactory progress each semester toward completing the degree, the  \nLTI may remove the m from the program . See section on \u201cEnd of Semester Evaluation .\u201d \n4.2.6 Time Away from Academic Responsibilities  \nPh.D. s tudents that are supported by sponsored research, fellowships, or scholarships are \nexpected to remain on campus and work fu lltime on their education and research throughout the \nyear, regardless of whether classes are in session or not. 40 hours per week is a common level of \neffort.  \nOrdinarily, students are not expected to work during official university holidays , however \nstudents may need to consult their advisor about expectations and alternate arrangements if there \nare challenges with taking time off during a university holiday, for example, if an experiment requires continuous monitoring. In such situations, the student and their advisor may agree for \nthe student to take an equal number of days off at another time. \nStudents with fulltime financial support are entitled to four weeks per  year of paid vacation , \nwhich must be scheduled in consultation with the ir advisor . \n4.3 CMU Academic Policies  \n4.3.1 Drop/Add/Withdraw Procedures  \nAdd, drop, withdrawals, and pass/no pass election procedures and deadlines are described on a \nHub web page . Note that the deadlines for doctoral courses may differ slightly; see the deadlines \nfor doctoral course sections in the Academic Calendar .  \nDoctoral students, visiting/non -degree students, and certificate students do not receive vouchers \nand do not participate in the voucher process.

Note that ABD status is different \nfrom ABD in absentia (ABS) status. A student in ABS status cannot receive any support from the university (including an y research projects within the university), cannot use most university \nfacilities, and does not pay any tuition until they are ready to defend their thesis. ABS students must register for five (5) units of dissertation research in the semester they defend;  in keeping \nwith university policy, the LTI (and its projects and faculty) cannot pay for these five units. The \nstudent can (and should) register for these five units only after they defend; just in case the defense \ndate slips to the next semester.  \nStudent s entering ABD or ABS status must complete the All But Dissertations Status Agreement\n. \n4.3.4 Statute of Limitations: Time to Degree  \nAs outlined in the Doctoral Student Status Policy , students will complete all requirements for the \nPh.D. degree within a maximum of ten years from original matriculation as a doctoral student, or less if required by a more restrictive department or college policy. Once this time -to-degree limit \nhas lapsed, the person may resume work towards a doctoral degree only if newly admitted to a currently offered doctoral degree program under criteria determined by that program. Under extraordinary circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, family or parental leave, or temporary disability, a school or college may, upon the relevant departmen t's \nrecommendation and with the written approval of the dean, defer the lapse of All But Dissertation status for a period commensurate with the duration of that interruption. Students, who are pursuing the Ph.D. degree as part- time students for all semesters of their program, as approved by \ntheir program, may also appeal to their program or department for extension of the time to degree limit.  \nUnder extraordinary circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, family or parental leave, or temporary disability, a school or college may, upon the relevant department\u2019s \nrecommendation and with the written approval of the dean, defer the lapse of All But Dissertation status for a period commensurate with the duration of that interruption.

This document summarizes processes available to \ngraduate students who seek review of academic and non -academic issues. Generally, graduate \nstudents are expected to seek informal resolution of all concerns within the applicable department, unit, or program before invok ing formal processes.

Obligations once undertaken must be met, commitments kept.  \n As members of the Carnegie Mellon community, individuals are expected to uphold the standards of the community in addition to holding others accountable for said standards. It is rare that the life of a student in an academic community can be so private that it will not affect the community as a whole or that the above standards do not apply.  \n The discovery, advancement and communication of knowledge are not possible without a \ncommitment to these standards. Creativity cannot exist without acknowledgment of the \ncreativity of others. New knowledge cannot be developed without credit for prior knowledge. Without the ability to trust that these principles will be observed, an academic community cannot exist.  \nThe commitment of its faculty, staff and students to these standards contributes to the high respect in which the Carnegie Mellon degree is held. Students must not destroy that respect by their failure to meet these standards. Students who cannot meet them should voluntarily withdraw from the university.  \nThe Carnegie Mellon Code can also be found on -line at \nhttp://www.cmu.edu/student-\naffairs/theword/code.html  \n1.7 Vision  \nCarnegie Mell on University will have a transformative impact on society through continual \ninnovation in education, research, creativity, and entrepreneurship.  \n     ", "MLT Graduate Student Handbook  Page 10 \n 1.8 Mission  \nTo create a transformative educational experience for students focused on deep disciplinary \nknowl edge; problem solving; leadership, communication, and interpersonal skills; and personal \nhealth and well -being. \nTo cultivate a transformative university community dedicated to a) attracting and retaining diverse, world -class talent; b) creating a collaborative environment open to the free exchange \nof ideas, where research, creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship can flourish; and c) ensuring individuals can achieve their full potential.  \nTo impact society in a transformative way \u2014regionally, nationally, and globally \u2014by engaging \nwith partners outside the traditional borders of the university campus.  \n1.9 Consensual Intimate Relationship Policy Regarding Undergraduate \nStudents \nThis policy addresses the circumstances in which romantic, sexual, or amorous \nrelation ships/interactions with undergraduate students, even if consensual, are inappropriate \nand prohibited.

Standard prog ram lengths for graduate students vary significantl y-- ranging \nfrom two semesters for some full -time master\u2019s programs to several or more years for doctoral \nprograms. Upon completion of the graduate program degree requirements, the degree will be \ncertified by the student\u2019s academic program in the semester in which the student completes the requirements.  \n3.1.2 Early Completion  \nGraduate students who consider the completion of all degree requirements in less than the \nstandard length of time for their program of study may consult with their degree -granting \nprogram or department to determine if early degree certification is allowed and under what \ncircumstances.  ", "MLT Graduate Student Handbook  Page 12 \n 3.1.3 Extended or Longer -than -Standard Completion (Statute of Limitations)  \nLonger -than -standard degree completion may occur due to academic interruptions in making \nprogress toward the degree as defined by the academic  program, interruptions of full -time \nstudy or progress towards the degree due to  serious, documented medical iss ues, or other \nunusual or unforeseen  circumstances.  \nMaster\u2019s students who require longer than the standard time to complete their  degree \nrequirements are expected to remain in close contact with their  graduate program, and will be \ncertified at the end of the semester in which they  have completed their degree requirements. \nStudents shall reference CMU Policy on Master\u2019s Student Statute of Limitations  (www.cmu.edu/policies/student- and- student- life/masters -students -statute -of limitations.html) \nregarding gu idelines and restrictions which place an upper limit on the maximum length of time \nallowable for master\u2019s degree completion and  certification.  \n3.1.4 Additional Guidance for Students \n\u2022 Program of Study: Students seeking guidance about their program of study and degree \nrequirements should consult with their academic advisor and/ or appropriate  associate \ndean.  \n\u2022 Financial Aid and Student Account: Students are expected to make normal progress  \ntoward their degree to  graduate within the standard timeframe for their program of \nstudy. Under U.S. Federal Title IV regulations, student eligibility  for federal financial aid \nis contingent upon enrollment in and successful  completion of courses that are counted \nas credit toward their current degree program. To receive  the maximum amount of \nfederal financial aid for which they may be eligible, students must enroll each semester \nin at least 36 units  that count toward their current degree level. (See separate guidance \nregarding  integrated degree completion.) Students s hould consult with their designated \ncollege liaison in The HUB regarding  billing and financial aid, particularly for early \ncompletion, longer -than standard completion, or integrated undergraduate and \nmaster\u2019s degree programs .   \n\u2022 International Students: Im migration status for students in F -1 and J -1 non -immigrant \nstatus is tied to making normal progress toward completing degree requirements . \nTherefore, F -1 and J -1 students who are considering completing their  degree \nrequirements early, anticipating longer- than- standard completion, or moving from an \nundergraduate to a graduate student classification ( integrated undergraduate -graduate \nstudy) should consult with their designated  advisor in the Office of International Education (OIE) to ensure compliance wi th  immigration regulations.  \n ", "MLT Graduate Student Handbook  Page 13 \n 4 MLT Degree Attainment  \n4.1 Course Requirements  \nIn order to  complete the Master of Language Technologies degree, the student must pass 120 \nor more course units of senior- to-graduate courses, and meet the following criteria:  \n\u2022 within those 120 units, at least 72 units of \u201cLTI\u201d courses and 24 units of \u201cSCS\u201d courses, \n\u2022 within those 72 units, 11 -711, 11- 791 (or an equivalent , see below ), and one ``Task \nOrientation Focus'' class, and  \n\u2022 within those 72 units, at least one of the following:  \no an LTI lab course,  \no 11-792, or  \no project -oriented Masters \u2019 thesis;  \n\u2022 Of the remaining 24 unit s, 12 must be 11- 910 Directed Research ; \n\u2022 The final 12 units are an Open Elective.  \nThe student must also complete two summers of full -time directed research, attend the LTI \nColloquium (11 -700) each semester, and satisfy the Research Speaking Requirement desc ribed \nelsewhere.  \nSince 11 -791 is not being offered currently, the faculty have defined a list of acceptable \nsubstitute courses:  \n\u2022 11-727: Computational Semantics for NLP ( only if the course project was done as a \ngroup project)   \n\u2022 11-731: Machine Translation  \n\u2022 11-747: Neural Networks for NLP  \n\u2022 11-751:  Speech Recognition  \n\u2022 11-775:  Large -Scale Multimedia  \n\u2022 11-776: Multimodal Affective Computing  \n\u2022 11-777: Multimodal Machine Learning  \n\u2022 11-785:  Deep Learning  \n\u2022 11-797: Question Answering  \n \nStudents may request to have other  LTI course s with a group engineering project component to \nbe added to this list.   \nFor definitions of quoted terms, see the section on \u201cDefinitions of LTI Terminology .\u201d \nUnless approved by the Program Director in advance, t he course requirements must be \nsatisfied by actual classroom courses, not credit given for research or independent study.  ", "MLT Graduate Student Handbook  Page 14 \n Note that a Masters \u2019 Thesis is not required in general, although a thesis project may be used to \nsatisfy the \u201clab\u201d requirement.  \n \n4.1.1 Grade Requirements  \nStudents must demonstrate their mastery of material taught in courses and their success in \napplying their skills in directed study by satisfying the following grade requirements:  \n1. Minimum grade:  Only courses with a grade of C (2.0) or higher are counted as satisfying a degree requirement.  \n2. Pass/fail:   Pass/fail grades are not permitted for courses and projects used to satisfy a \ndegr ee requirement.  \n4.1.2 Research Speaking Requirement  \nTo emphasize student research, improve public speaking skills , and increase internal awareness \nof LTI work, all MLT students must complete an oral presentation in their second year (by the \nend of May). The presentation should consist of a 20 -minute talk plus time for discussion. It \nmust be advertised to the LTI mailing lists at least one week before your presentation, and the \npublic will be invited.  \nAt least two CMU faculty members will attend the presentation, including the research advisor. \nAfter the presentation, these faculty members will convene and provide written feedback to both the student and the chair of graduate programs (the form for this is available on the LTI website). This feedback will help the student refine speaking skills with respect to talk structure, content, and delivery.  \n4.1.3 Withdrawal of a Degree  \nThe University reserves the right to withdraw a degree even though it has been granted should \nthere be discovery that the work upon which it was based or the academic records in support of \nit had been falsified. In such a case, withdrawal of the degree will occur promptly upon discovery of the falsification. The complete reference to this University policy is available at https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student- life/withdrawal- of-a-degree.html\n.  \n4.2 Advising  \nEach student has a faculty advisor charged with guiding the education and monitoring the \nprogress of the student through the program. The advisor also supervises the student's directed \nstudy projects. This personal student- advisor relationship ensures that every student receives \nthe necessary faculty mentoring. The advisor also provides the student with career advice.  ", "MLT Graduate Student Handbook  Page 15 \n How and when the advisor is selected: the Marriage Process:  Advisors are selected during the \nfirst month of the program. Students are expected to attend the LTI's Orientation (\u201cImmigration \nCourse ,\u201d or IC) lectures, in which faculty describe their interests and areas of expertise, and to \nbe proactive about meeting individually with potential advisors. After meeting with several \npotential advisors, each student will be asked to indicate a firs t, second, and third choice for \nadvisor. Meanwhile, the potential advisors determine how many new students they can take, \nand indicate their preferences. Finally, the  entire LTI faculty meets as a \u201c Marriage Committee \u201d \nto determine the best set of matches.  \nSome entering MLT students are prefunded, meaning they have received and accepted a funding letter from a faculty member before the Marriage Process. (Even students who are prefunded must attend the research talks, to become acquainted with the LTI\u2019s rese arch \nprojects.) Even self -supporting MLT students are expected to perform research with a faculty \nadvisor, since research experience is an important part of our graduate programs. Until a student finds a specific advisor, the chair of the LTI graduate prog rams serves as the advisor.  \nHow to change advisors:  The initial advisor selection should be made carefully. However, it is \npossible to change advisors. To do so, the student should find another faculty member willing \nto serve as an advisor, and then make a  request to the Program Director to switch advisors. The \nLTI follows the long -standing SCS policy that both the new and old advisors need to agree to the \nchange; typically, this is not a problem ( assuming the new advisor has agreed in advance, as \ndescribed  here ). It is to the student's advantage to avoid switching advisors, especially late in \ntheir graduate studies, because forging a strong student- advisor relationship takes time.  \n4.3 Optional Masters\u2019  Thesis  \nMLT students may optionally  elect to complete a Mast ers\u2019 Thesis; it is not  required. Students \nwho intend to apply for the PhD program should consider the MLT Thesis as one of several \nways to demonstrate their research potential. Other possibilities include innovative research in a research project or class project work.  \nThe MLT Thesis must be completed according to the following guidelines. Note in particular the October 31 proposal deadline!  \n\u2022 There are two course components required for students who elect to complete the M.S. Thesis: 11 -928 \u2013 Masters \u2019 Thesis I (with the chosen thesis advisor, typically for 12 units, \ntypically in the Fall of their second year) and 11 -929 \u2013 Masters \u2019 Thesis II in the following \nSpring.  \n\u2022 Each of these two courses counts towards 6 units of MLT -level LTI course credit; if the \nstudent goes on to an LTI PhD, the second course (11 -929) counts towards one PhD lab \nrequirement.   \n\u2022 The MLT thesis may focus on either a significant research result or a significant implementation of a new technology. The student should work with their adv isor to \ndefine an interesting but bounded thesis research project. The MLT thesis culminates in ", "MLT Graduate Student Handbook  Page 16 \n a publication -quality paper that clearly describes the work in terms of its research \nsignificance.  \n\u2022 The MLT thesis committee will be composed of a thesis advisor  and two additional \nreaders, to be chosen by the student in consultation with the advisor, during the Fall \nMasters \u2019 Thesis I course. At least 2  of the 3 committee members must be SCS faculty \nworking in Language Technologies.  \n\u2022 To receive a final grade for the first semester's course, the student must have prepared a written proposal of at least five pages, describing the scientific thesis to be investigated, any relevant research already completed by the student, a comparison \nwith related work by others, and a detailed description of the work to be done in the \nnext semester. The proposal MUST be accepted by the committee by the end of \nOctober , or the student will not be allowed to enroll in 11 -929 \u2013 Masters \u2019 Thesis II!  \n\u2022 Sometime d uring the semester when the student enrolls in 11 -929 \u2013 Masters \u2019 Thesis II \n(typically, their final semester), the student will distribute a draft of the thesis to the committee for initial review. This should be done as early as feasible, to avoid last -\nminute surprises that could delay final approval of the thesis.  \n\u2022 The thesis work culminates in submission of the final version of the thesis document, followed by a public presentation of the work in an LTI seminar (or other suitable public forum). Since the defense is public, the LTI graduate program administrator must receive all the information required for a public announcement at least one week before the defense. The Masters \u2019 Thesis presentation is somewhat less rigorous than a PhD \nthesis defense. The pre sentation must communicate the research work done, similar to \na conference paper presentation. The committee will observe the presentation, and then decide whether the thesis and presentation were acceptable, or whether further \nwork is required. Unlike a P hD defense, only a simple majority vote of the committee is \nrequired for approval.  \n\u2022 Although students are required to enroll in the appropriate course sequence of two Masters \u2019 Thesis courses, it is not required that students finish the thesis by the end of \nthat second semester. If a student requires more time to revise the thesis to the committee's satisfaction, and adequately present the work, an incomplete grade will be assessed in the Masters \u2019 Thesis course, until such time as the work and presentation ar e \naccepted. The student will still be allowed to walk in Spring Commencement, if all other requirements for the MLT degree have been completed. Students should note that any financial support beyond the end of the semester will be on a case -by-case basis, and \nmust be arranged in advance with the project supporting them. Students are strongly encouraged to finish the thesis work within one (1) year following the semester they enroll for the first Masters \u2019 Thesis course.  \n \n \n  ", "MLT Graduate Student Handbook  Page 17 \n 4.4 Definitions of LTI Terminology  \nWe define here some of the terms as used in this handbook:  \n\u2022 An \u201cLTI course\u201d is any 12 -unit course with a number of 11 -XXX; a 6 -unit course with an \n11-XXX counts as 1/2 of an LTI course. Unless otherwise specified, \"course\" means an \nactual classroom course, not  credit given for research or independent study. Note that \nwe will allow any one MLD (10 -xxx) graduate- level course to count as an \u201cLTI course.\u201d  \n\u2022 An \u201cSCS course\u201d is any 12 -unit course with a course number indicating a unit of the \nSchool of Computer Science (including LTI); a 6 -unit course with such a number counts \nas 1/2 of an SCS course. Unless otherwise specified, \"course\" means an actual classroom \ncourse, not credit given for research or independent study.

He will decide, with advice from faculty in the appropriate area, whether it should be in the Focus Area, and if approved it will be added to the LTI Focus Area webpage.  \no A \u201cTask -Orientation Focus Course\u201d is simply a course belonging to that LTI Focus \nArea, as listed on the \u201cCourse Categories\u201d webpage.  \n\u2022 An LTI \u201clab course\u201d is simply a course in the list of lab courses def ined in the LTI \u201cCourse \nCategories\u201d webpage.  \n4.5 Recommended Electives outside of SCS  \nStudents are free to take elective courses outside the SCS, at Carnegie Mellon or cross -\nregistered at the University of Pittsburgh, as long as the student fulfills the requi rements of \ntheir program as described above. The student should discuss any such electives in advance with their advisor; typical choices might include ECE courses for Speech students, Pitt Linguistics courses, or Statistics courses.  \nNote: recommended electives outside of the SCS count towards the \u201cSCS\u201d course requirement. Please see the Program Director for approval of electives as \u201cSCS. \u201d \nNote also that students need advance approval for any courses not covered by their normal tuition (e.g., summer courses ). The grading of outside courses is the responsibility of the \ndepartment offering the course; however , the LTI's Minimum Course Grade Policy described \nabove still applies (\u201c B-\u201d is the minimu m for PhD, \u201c C\u201d for MLT).  \n ", "MLT Graduate Student Handbook  Page 18 \n 4.6 LTI Orientation  \nAt the beginning of each  Fall semester, the LTI provides a set  of lectures and talks to help \nstudents learn about the work done by CMU faculty and to provide an opportunity for advisors \nto recruit new students.  Students are expected to attend them and treat them  seriously, \nbecause they provide a good introduction to the broad range of research done at the LTI.  \nStudents do not register for the LTI Orientation, nor do they receive  a grade;  however , the \ndepartment is serious about its expectation that new students will attend these talks.  \nFor many years, these talks were called \"the Immigration Course (IC)\" , which caused confusion.  \nThe older name has been retired;  however , people who have been at CMU a long time may \noccasionally use the older name.    \n4.7 End of Semester  Evaluation \nNear the end of the spring and fall  semester s, the student must prepare a statement that \ndescribes their  achievements in the current semester, and plans for the next semester. At the \nend of the semester, the faculty evaluates each student's academic progress. The student's advisor serves as the student's advocate in this process. The result of the evaluation is a letter from the faculty to the student that indicates whether the student is making satisfactory progress  towards completing the degre e. \nA good letter  typically indicates that the student is making satisfactory progress. If the student \nis doing exceptionally good work, a stronger adjective such as excellent  might be used, but this \nis unusual.  \nIf a student seems to be having trouble, the faculty determines whether it believes that the student can finish the degree, and if so, what needs to be accomplished to get back on track. This type of letter should be considered a serious warning. It is not a permanent \u201cblack mark\u201d  \non the student's record; if the student begins making satisfactory progress again, there is no official record of the letter in the student's transcript.  \nIn the most serious cases, the faculty gives the student an N- 1 letter that specifies a list of \nconditions that the student must satisfy by specific deadlines. Failure to meet all of the \nspecified conditions may result in the student's termination from the program.  \n4.8 Enrollment Verification  \nEnrollment Services is the only University office that can provide an official letter of enrollment, \nofficial transcript and enrollment verification.

The Carnegie Mellon University transcript will include information on such courses as follows: Carnegie Mellon cours es and courses taken through the university's cross -registration program \nwill have grades recorded on the transcript and be factored into the QPA. All other courses will be recorded on this transcript indicating where the course was taken, but without grade. Such courses will not be taken into account for academic actions, honors , or QPA calculations.

It is \nthe responsibility of the entire community to establish and maintain the integrity of our \nuniversity. ", "MLT Graduate Student Handbook  Page 20 \n Carnegie Mellon University educates its students to become professionals who will serve \nsociety with integrity. The university also creates and disseminates new knowledge and expressions of knowledge in ways that benefit society. Carnegie Mellon strives to serve the changing needs of society through the three primary goals outlined in its mission statement: to \ncreate and disseminate knowledge and art through research and artistic expression, teaching \nand learning and transfer to society;  to serve students by teaching them leadership, problem-\nsolving skills, and the values of quality, ethical behavior, responsibility to society and \ncommitments to work; and to pursue the advantages provided by a diverse community, open \nto the exchange of ideas, where discovery and artistic creativity can flourish.  \nIn any presentation, creative, artistic or resear ch, it is the ethical responsibility of each student \nto identify the conceptual sources of the work submitted. Failure to do so is dishonest and is the basis for a charge of cheating or plagiarism, which is subject to disciplinary action.  \n The university has a very clear and specific protocol for responding to alleged violations of \nacademic integrity.

Please see https://www.cmu.edu/student- affairs/theword/academic -discipline/\n for more information.  \nImportant note:   The LTI implements the above policy\u2019s option of \u201cconven[ing] a disciplinary \nhearing according to the procedures of the department/program.\u201d  Our procedure is as follows: \na first violation is grounds for dismiss al from the graduate program. If we decide not to \nimmediately dismiss, the first violation will result in the student being on disciplinary probation. \nIf a student commits a second violation while on probation, the penalty is dismissal from the \ngraduate pr ogram.  \n5 Academic Policies  \n5.1 MLT Academic Policies  \n5.1.1 Duration of Study  \nMLT students enrolled for full -time study are expected to complete the degree in two calendar \nyears (24 months).  This includes two summers of full -time directed research.  \nSee also the \u201c Statute of Lim itations\u201d policy.  \n5.1.2 Double-Dipping \nA Masters student who uses courses taken as part of another degree program (at Carnegie \nMellon or elsewhere) toward their program requirements cannot use those same courses ", "MLT Graduate Student Handbook  Page 21 \n toward any other M.S. degree offered by the School of Computer Science without prior \napproval. This is an SCS- wide policy.  \n5.1.3 Pass/Fail Grades  \nPass/fail grades are not permitted for courses used to satisfy a degree requirement. Graduate \nstudents who are required to take additional undergraduate courses to build up the core \nfoundations of computer science may not elect the pass/fail option for these courses.  \n5.1.4 Independent Study  \nFor an Independent Study to satisfy a n MLT  student\u2019s coursework requirements, it must be \napproved by the MLT Program Director in advance .  In consultation with the CMU faculty \nmember who will be supervising the Independent Study, the student should produce a short (half -page to one page) description of the goals of the Independent Study, and how the results \nwill be evaluated, and submit it to the Program Director before the end of the Add period of the semester of the proposed study. The study should be planned so that it is finished in time for the supervising faculty member to give a grade at the end of the semester.  Independent studies may be undertaken for 6 or 12 units. Normally only one Independent Study would be \napproved during a student\u2019s MLT coursework.  \n5.1.5 Transfer Credit  \nAn equivalent graduate course previously completed at another institution may be permitted to \nsatisfy one of the MLT course requirements. The decision on whether a course may be \ntransferred is made by the MLT Program Director. Typically , the student will provide the \nProgram Director with the syllabus of the external course, and the Program Director will use that and the student\u2019s transcript to make the decision.  \nSee the section on \u201cDefinition of transfer credit versus course exemption .\u201d \nAll MLT students are required to take a minimum of 96 units of coursework at CMU.  \n5.1.6 External Internships \nMLT students may only engage in internships if their advisors recommend it, since the program is 24 months, including summers. International students are required to consult with the Office \nof International Education for eligibility before  seeking an internship/co -op or signing a n offer \ncontract.  \nWe caution all students to be aware of potential intellectual property (IP) problems with internships, and to review any IP agreements with their advisors before signing them. It is possible to lose ownership of your ideas.  \nImportant:  See also section 4.2.3, External Employment/Consulting.  ", "MLT Graduate Student Handbook  Page 22 \n 5.1.7 Transferring Into the MLT Program  \nTransfers into the MLT program are not permitted during a student\u2019s first semester at CMU. \nStudents must begin their study at CMU in the program that admitted them; this  is a university \npolicy.  \nStudents may request to transfer into the MLT program after completing their first semester. The student must make the request in writing (or email) to the MLT/PhD Admissions Chair. The \nMLT/PhD Admissions Chair will inform the student about what application materials are \nrequired;  for example, an explanation of why a transfer is desired, a proposed plan of study, a \nproposed advisor, and CMU transcripts. Students that are already enrolled in an LTI degree program are not required to retake GRE and TOEFL exams or to produce new transcripts from other universities. The MLT program will conduct an expedited admissions process after receiving such a request.   \n5.1.8 Transferring Out of the MLT Program  \nThe MLT program does not prevent students from transferring to another degree program. Each degree program has its own rules about whether and when transfers into the program are permitted. A student that is interested in transferring out of the MLT degree program should \nconsult the handbook and Pr ogram Director of the desired degree program to learn whether \ntransfers are permitted, and if so, how and when to request such a transfer.  \n5.1.9 Drop/Add/Withdraw Procedures  \nStudents taking undergraduate and Masters\u2019 level courses must follow the procedures and \ndeadlines for adding, dropping, and withdrawing from courses as identified on the academic \ncalendar. Information can be found at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/course-\nchanges.index . Please note that there is a separate calendar for doctoral courses that does not \napply to Masters\u2019 students.  \n5.1.10   Statute of Limitations  \nAs outlined in the Master\u2019s Students Statute of Limitations, \nhttps://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student- life/masters -students-statute- of- \nlimitations.html. Students will complete all requirements for the m a sters\u2019 degree within a \nmaximum of seven years from original matriculation as a masters\u2019  student, or less if required by \na more restrictive department, school, or college policy.  Once this time -to-degree limit has \nlapsed, the person may resume work towards a masters\u2019 degree only if newly admitted to a \ncurrently offered master s\u2019 degree program under criteria determined by that program.  \nSee also the \u2018Duration of Study\u2019 policy.  ", "MLT Graduate Student Handbook  Page 23 \n 5.1.11   Teaching Requirements  \nMLT students do not normally serve as Teaching Assistants (TAs).  If an MLT student wants to \nTA a course, they must get the approval of their research advisor.  \nIn the unusual case of an MLT student TAing, note that graduate students are required to have a certain level of fluency in English before they can instruct in Pennsylvania, as required by the English Fluency in Higher Education Act of 1990. Through this Act, all institutions of higher \neducation in the state are required to evaluate and certify the English fluency of all instructional \npersonnel, including teaching assistants and interns. The full University policy can be reviewed at \nhttps://www.cmu.edu/policies/faculty/evaluation- certification -english -fluency-\ninstructors.html . \nThe fluency of all instructional personnel will be rated by Language Support in the S tudent \nAcademic Success Center to determine at what level of responsibility the student can TA. In addition to administering the International Teaching Assistant (ITA) Test (a mandatory screening for all non -native speakers of English), Language Support in the Student Academic \nSuccess Center helps teaching assistants who are non- native English speakers develop fluency \nand cultural understanding to teach successfully at Carnegie Mellon. Visit the Student Academic \nSuccess Center website for additional information: https://www.cmu.edu/student- success/\n.  \n5.2 LTI Academic Policies  \n5.2.1 \u201cGrandfather\u201d policy  \nA student can graduate under the policies in effect at the time that the student entered the \nprogram; or, at the student's choice, the student can graduate under policies that are adopted after the student entered the program. If it is not realistic to follow a particular policy exactly, the department may approximate the policy as closely as possible; this situation is rare and typically arises only when a student is enrolled in the program for an extended period of time.  \n5.2.2 Definition of transfer credit  versus course exemption  \nThe LTI may grant transfer credit or issue an exemption  for equivalent graduate courses \npreviously completed at another institution. This decision rests with the chair of the particular program. If a student is exempt  from a required course due to prior courses or experience, the \nstudent can replace that course with an open elective. The student does not receive credit for the external course, but can take any course that could normally count toward the degree in its place. If a student receives c redit  for prior coursework completed at CMU or elsewhere, the \nstudent receives that many units of credit, and the total amount of required coursework is \nreduced by that amount.  ", "MLT Graduate Student Handbook  Page 24 \n 5.2.3 External Employment/Consulting  \nStudents funded by LTI research projects are nor mally expected to work exclusively for those \nprojects. Since consulting may provide  useful experience, students are generally permitted to \nconsult, at most , one eight -hour day per seven -day week, only with the advisor's consent. \nInternational students must also have approval in advance from the Office of International \nEducation (OIE); otherwise, they may be in violation of their visa status.  \nImportant: Any work for pay outside of the funding research project must be approved in \nadvance by the advisor (and OIE, for international students).   This includes paid TAing, \nconsulting, online free -lancing, etc.  \n5.2.4 Leave of Absence  \nThe LTI discourages Leaves of Absence (LOA), since students usually do not return, despite good intentions. However, a student in good standing may be granted a LOA of at most 1 year, upon written request to the Program Director and with consent of the student's advisor. It is the \nresponsibility of the student on LOA to contact the LTI to initiate a return to the program.  \n5.2.5 Satisfactory Progress  \nIf a student does not make satisfactory progress each semester toward completing the degree, \nthe LTI may remove the student from the program.  See section on \u201cEnd of Semester \nEvaluation .\u201d \n5.2.6 Winter and Summer Breaks  \nStudents supported by research projects are expected to remain on campus working during breaks in classes. A two -week vacation is ty pically allowed in the summer. The normal winter \nbreak policy is that the student works 40 hours per week for two weeks, and takes vacation for the other two weeks.  \n5.3 CMU Academic Policies  \n5.3.1 Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities \nhttp://www.cmu.edu/disability- resources   \nThe Office of Disability Resources at Carnegie Mellon University has a continued mission to provide physical and programmatic campus access to all events and information within the Carnegie Mellon community.  We work to ensure that qualified individuals rec eive reasonable \naccommodations as guaranteed by the Americans with Disabilitie s Act (ADA) and Section  504 of \nthe Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  Students who would like to receive accommodations can begin ", "MLT Graduate Student Handbook  Page 25 \n the process through Disability Resources\u2019 secure online portal  or email \naccess@andrew.cmu.edu  to begin the interactive accommodation proce ss.   \nStudents with physical, sensory, cognitive, or emotional disabilities are encouraged to self -\nidentify with the Office of Disability Resources and request needed accommodations.

This document summarizes  \nprocesses available to graduate students who seek review of academic and non- academic \nissues. Generally, graduate students are expected to seek informal resolution of all concerns within the applicable department, unit, or program before invoking formal p rocesses. When an \ninformal resolution cannot be reached, however, a graduate student who seeks further review of the matter is to follow the for mal procedures outlined here. T hese appeal and grievance \nprocedures shall apply to students in all graduate programs of the University. Students should refer to the department specific information in this handbook for department and college \ninformation about the administration and aca demic policies of the program.  \n \n5.3.3 Process for Appealing Final Grades  \nhttps://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/academic/appeal -of-grades -and academic -\nactions.html    \nFinal grades will be changed only in exceptional circumstances and only with the approval of \nthe instructor and the department, unit, or program. Grading is a  matter of sound discretion of \nthe instructor, and final grades are rarely changed without the consent of the instructor who assigned the grade. The following circumstances are the unusual exceptions that may warrant a grade appeal:  \na) The final grade assigned for a course is based on manifest error (e.g., a clear error such as arithmetic error in computing a grade or failure to grade one of the answers on an exam)  \nb) The faculty or staff member who assigned the grade did so in violation of \nUniversity policy.  \n ", "MLT Graduate Student Handbook  Page 26 \n 5.3.4 Safeguarding Educational Equity:  \nSexual Misconduct Policy  \nThe University prohibits sex -based discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating/ \ndomestic violence, and stalking.

The protocols on this page are designed to support the parental needs of students and their families.  \nStudents seeking any of the parental accommodations described below must register with the Office of the Dean of Students by contacting the office for an appointment by calling 412-268- 2075.  \nStudents are encouraged to register with the Office of the Dean of Students ninety (90) days in advance of the anticipated arrival of the child as applicable in the individual circumstances. At \nthe time  of registration, students will have the opportunity to consult about resources, \nprocedures, funding options, and preparation for discussing academic accommodations with \nthe student\u2019s academic department. Students should also consult with their academic advisors either before or in conjunction with registering with the Office of the Dean of Students.  \nAccommodations for Gestational Parents  \nThe birth of a child is a significant life event that may require time away from academic pursuits for delivery and reco very from delivery of a newly born child. Students whose anticipated \ndelivery date is during the course of a semester  may need to take time away from their \nacademic responsibilities. Carnegie Mellon students seeking time away are afforded two \noptions as a possible accommodation:  ", "MLT Graduate Student Handbook  Page 27 \n \u2022 Short -term accommodation for gestational parents  \u2013 A short -term absence \nfrom academic responsibilities up to a maximum of six (6) weeks. Short term \naccommodations may be extended by two (2) weeks for a total of eight (8) weeks, wher e a longer absence is medically necessary. Prior to the absence \nstudents must work with relevant university faculty and staff to adjust their course work, research, teaching and other academic responsibilities during the period of absence. This may include  extensions of time to complete assignments, \nincomplete grades, and/or dropping courses, shifting research  responsibilities \nand adjusting TA assignments. Students who take a  short-t erm ac commodation \nwill remain enrolled.  \n\u2022 Formal Leave of Absence - A formal leave of absence under the Student Leave \nPolicy. Generally, the Student Leave Policy permits students to take a leave of absence for a full -semester, mini- semester, or for the time remaining in the \nsemester during which the leave is taken.  Students who take a Formal Leave of \nAbsence (\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/student-\nleave.html) drop all remaining courses for the semester and are unenrolled for \nthe semester. International students must consult with the Office of International Education (https://www.cmu.edu/oie/) before considering this  \noption due to visa implications.  \nFinancial Assistance for Student Parents  \nCarnegie Mellon also offers the following options for financial assistance to students who become parents while enrolled:  \nInterest- free Loan \u2013 Any student who becomes a parent is eligible to apply for an interest- free \nparental loan ( https://www.cmu.edu/student- affairs/dean/loans/\n) from the Office of the Dean \nof Students.  \n6 Financial Issues  \n6.1 Graduate Student Funding  \nFor all LTI MLT students, full funding (tuition plus stipend) is guaranteed for the first year. This support is normally continued for the duration of the program, subject to continuing satisfactory progress and availability of funding. The fellowship includes full tuition and fees, \nand a monthly MLT stipend. In addition, the LTI pays a dependency allowance of 10% of the \nstudent's monthly stipend to any student with a child, unless they have a spouse who earns \nmore than $200 per month.  \nIf an MLT student receives an outside graduate fellowship (e.g., NSF, Fulbright), the student is expected to accept it in place of the LTI\u2019s graduate fellowship. As an extra incentive to do so, \nthe LTI will supplement the award so that the student will receive full tuition and a combined ", "MLT Graduate Student Handbook  Page 28 \n stipend 10 percent higher than that of the standard LTI graduate fellowship. Students are \nrequired to inform the LTI about any external funding that they receive.  \n6.2 University Financial Aid  \nGraduate students should consult the graduate student financial aid information found on The \nHUB website: http://www.cmu.edu/finaid/graduate/index.html . \n6.3 Conference Travel Funding  \nStudents funded by a research project receive travel funding according to policies set by the \nindividual projects.  Students who have no project funding may be provided with partial funding, \nwith a larger amount available for travel to presen t a refereed conference paper. There is an LTI \nform that must be filled out in advance. \n6.4 Office of the Dean of Students Emergency Support Funding  \nGraduate students who find themselves in need of immediate funds for emergency situations should contact the Office of the Dean of Students (see Appendix A), \nwww.cmu.edu/student-\naffairs/index.html , to inquire about the types of emergency funding available to enrolled \nstudents. \n6.5 Health Insurance  \nCarnegie Mellon has a Student Health Insurance pol icy requiring full -time, degree -seeking \nstudents to carry adequate medical insurance. Students must either purchase the plan offered \nby the University , or an application for a waiver can be made if the student is \u201cenrolled as the \ndependent, partner/spouse or pr incipal in an employer or government -sponsored insurance \nplan\u201d (see the Carnegie Mellon University Student Health Insurance Policy at \nhttp://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/StudentInsurance ).  \nThe LTI does not cover student health insurance, regardless of the students\u2019 funding situation. It is the responsibility of each student to make arrangements with Student Health Services to either pay for their insurance at the beginning of the semester, or elect a payment plan over the course of the academic year. Mor e information is available at the Student Health Services \nWeb site www.studentaffairs.cmu.edu/HealthServices/insurance .  \n   ", "MLT Graduate Student Handbook  Page 29 \n 6.6 Emergency Loans  \nhttp://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/index.html  \nAll students , regardless of their program, are eligible for the Emergency Student Loan, which is  \nan interest- free and emergency- based loan repayable within 30 days.

", "MIIS Graduate Student Handbook  Page 9 \n 1.6 The Carnegie Mellon Code  \nStudents at Carnegie Mellon, because they are members of an academic community dedicated \nto the achievement of excellence, are expected to meet the highest standards of personal, \nethical,  and moral conduct possible.  \n These standards require personal integrity, a commitment to honesty without compromise, as well as truth without equivocation and a willingness to place the good of the community \nabove the good of the self. Obligations once undertaken must be met, commitments kept.  \n As members of the Carnegie Mellon community, individuals are expected to uphold the \nstandards of the community in addition to holding others accountable for said standards. It is \nrare that the life of a student in an academic community can be so private that it will not affect \nthe community as a whole or that the above standards do not apply.   \nThe discovery, advancement and communication of knowledge are not possible without a commitment to these standards. Creativity cannot exist without acknowledgment of the \ncreativity of others. New knowledge cannot be developed without credit for prior knowl edge. \nWithout the ability to trust that these principles will be observed, an academic community \ncannot exist.  \nThe commitment of its faculty, staff and students to these standards contributes to the high respect in which the Carnegie Mellon degree is held. Students must not destroy that respect \nby their failure to meet these standards. Students who cannot meet them  should voluntarily \nwithdraw from the university.  \nThe Carnegie Mellon Code can also be found on -line at https://www.cmu. edu\n/student-\naffairs/theword/.  \n1.7 University Policies and Expectations  \nIt is the responsibility of each member of the Carnegie Mellon community to be familiar with \nuniversity policies and guidelines.

Laptops running Windows, MacOS, \nand Linux software are all acceptable.  \nMaster\u2019s  students will be given a CS user id.  A CS user id is required to use the LTI computer \ncluster, and other SCS services.  The School of Computer Science has a Help Center located at ", "MIIS Graduate Student Handbook  Page 11  \n GHC 4201.  They can be contacted at help@cs.cmu.edu, extension 8 -4231 from a campus \nphone, or 412 -268-4231 from an outside line.  \nMS students will be given access to the LTI\u2019s computer cluster on an as -needed basis, to be \nused for course assignments, directed study projects, and/or the capstone project.  The LTI \ncluster provides storage and computation for projects involving large datas ets and/or lengthy \ncomputation.   \n3 CMU Degree Completion and Certification  \n3.1 Standard Degree Requirements & Degree Certification  \nCarnegie Mellon graduate students are expected to complete their degree requirements within the standard length of time for their program of study as outlined in the relevant Graduate \nStudent Handbook. Standard program lengths for graduate students vary significantly ranging \nfrom two semesters for some full- time master\u2019s programs to several or more years for doctoral \nprograms. Upon completion of the graduate program degree requirements, the degree will be \ncertified by the student\u2019s academic program in the s emester in which the student completes \nthe requirements.  \nEarly  Completion  \nGraduate students who consider the completion of all degree requirements in less than the standard length of time for their program of study may consult with their degree -granting \nprogram or department to determine if early degree certification is allowed and under what circumstances . \n Extended or Longer- than- Standard Comp letion  \nLonger- than -standard degree completion may occur due to academic interruptions in making \nprogress toward the degree as defined by the academic program, interruptions of full -time study \nor progress towards the degree due to serious, documented medical issues, or other unusual or unforeseen circumstances.  \n Master\u2019s students who require longer than the standard time to complete their degree \nrequirements are expected to remain in close contact with their graduate program, and will be \ncertified at the end of the semester in which they have completed their degree requirements. \nStudents shall reference CMU Policy on Master\u2019s Student Statute of Limitations : \nwww.cmu.edu/policies/student -and- student- life/masters -students -statute -of limitations.html \nregarding guidelines and restrictions which place an upper limit on t he maximum length of \ntime allowable for master\u2019s degree completion and certification.  \n ", "MIIS Graduate Student Handbook  Page 12  \n 3.2 Statute of Limitations  \nAs outlined in the Master\u2019s Students Statute of Limitations, \nhttps://www.cmu.edu/policies/student- and-student- life/masters -students- statute -of-\nlimitations.html students will complete all requirements for the master\u2019s degree within a \nmaximum of seven years from original matriculation as a master\u2019s student, or less if required \nby a more restrictive department, school or college policy. Once this time -to-degree lim it has \nlapsed, the person may resume work towards a master\u2019s degree only if newly admitted to a currently offered master\u2019s degree program under criteria determined by that program.  \nUnder extraordinary circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, family \nor parental leave, or temporary disability, a school or college may, upon the relevant \ndepartment's recommendation and with the written approval of the dean (or  designate), defer \nthe lapse for a period commensurate with the duration of that interruption. Students who are \npursuing a master\u2019s degree as part- time students for all semesters of their program, as \napproved by their program, may also appeal to their program or department for extension of \nthe time to degree limit.  \n3.3 Additional Guidance for Students  \nProgram of Study  \nStudents seeking guidance about their program of study and degree requirements should consult with their academic advisor and/or appropriate associate dean.  \n Financial Aid and Student Account  \nStudents are expected to make normal progress toward their degree in order to graduate within the standard timeframe for their program of study. Under U.S. Federal Title IV regulations, \nstudent eligibility for federal financial aid is contingent upon enrol lment in and successful \ncompletion of courses that are counted as credit toward their current degree program. To receive the maximum amount of federal financial aid for which they may be eligible, students \nmust enroll each semester in at least 36 units that count toward their current degree level. (See \nseparate guidance regarding integrated degree completion.) Students should consult with their \ndesignated college liaison in The HUB regarding billing and financial aid, particularly for early completion, long er-than standard completion, or integrated undergraduate and master\u2019s degree \nprograms.   \n International Students  \nImmigration status for students in F -1 and J -1 nonimmigrant status is tied to making normal \nprogress toward completing degree requirements. Therefore, F -1 and J -1 students who are \nconsidering completing their degree requirements early, anticipating longer -than -standard \ncompletion, or moving from an undergraduate to a graduate student classification (integrated undergraduate -graduate study) should consult with their designated advisor in the Office of \nInternational Education (OIE) to ensure compliance with immigration regulations.  ", "MIIS Graduate Student Handbook  Page 13  \n 4 MIIS Degree Requirements and Related Policies/Protocols  \n4.1 Program Options  \nThe MIIS degree is offered in  two options:  \nOption 1.  Standard MIIS degree  (MIIS -16) - A 16 -month track that is completed in three \nacademic semesters (fall, spring, fall) and a summer internship.  \nOption 2.  MIIS: Advanced Study degree  (MIIS -21) - A 21 -month track that is completed in \nfour academic semesters (fall, spring, fall, spring) and a summer internship.  \nMIIS: Advanced Study track offers in depth  degree in one of the following areas of \nconcentration:  \n\u2022 Human Language for Language Technologies  \n\u2022 Language Technology Application  \n\u2022 Machine Learning for Language Technologies  \nPart- time options are available in some cases.  \n4.2 Required Units for Degree Attainment  \nTo complete the Master of Science in Intelligent Information Systems, a student must satisfy \nthree types of requirements.

Directed study requirement:  Students must pass 24 units (typically 12 units x 2 \nsemesters) in directed study under the supervision of their advisor. Directed study is a \nstructured, task -oriented form of independent study that provides deep, hands -on \nexperience in a particular technology area and an opportunity to work closely with a \nmember of the faculty.  \n2. Internship requirement:  Students must complete a one -semester (typically summer) \ninternship at an organization (typically a company or government agency) approved by \nthe MIIS Program Director. Internships are an opportunity to apply new skills in a \nprofessional setting and to le arn about software development in a \u2018real world\u2019 \norganization. Students with prior professional experience may petition the MIIS Program Director to waive this requirement.  \nMIIS students that do an internship during the summer semester are required to present their internship at a poster session at the beginning of the following Fall semester.  The poster and the student\u2019s participation in the poster session are part of the internship \nrequirement.  Participation is required unless waived in writing by the MIIS Program \nDirector.  \n3. Capstone requirements:  Students must complete a capstone project (36 units) and a \ncapstone planning seminar (6 units). The capstone requirement gives students \nexperience with collaborative, team -oriented software development; significant hands -\non experience with the techniques studied in the classroom; and an opportunity to work on a large software application.  \na. The capstone project (36 units) is a large, group- oriented demonstration of \nstudent skill in one or more areas covered by the degree. Typically,  the result of \nthe capstone project is a major software application. The capstone project is \nsupervised by a member of the faculty who meets with students on a weekly \nbasis to monitor progress and provide guidance.  ", "MIIS Graduate Student Handbook  Page 17  \n b. The capstone planning seminar (6 units) organizes students into groups; defines \ncapstone project goals, requirements, success metrics, and deliverables; and \nidentifies and acquires data, software, and other resources required for successful \ncompletion of the project. The planning seminar must be completed in the semester prior to taking the capstone project.  \n4.6 Registration Process/Procedures  \nStudents are responsible for registering for their courses. Use the Stellic Degree Audit \nApplication  to  monitor your progress and plan your degree. Students  can search for relevant \ncourses in a number of ways and share your plan with your advisor directly through the \napplication.   \nNavigate to the  SIO Academic Info tab and select Enrollment Status and the upcoming \nsemester to confirm the following:  \n\u2022 Enrollment Status is 'Eligible to Enroll' (if not, email  thehub@andrew.cmu.edu ) \n\u2022 Maximum units for which you can plan to register for (overloads are reviewed and \npermitted  only after  registration week)  \n\u2022 Class Level, College and Department are correct (if incorrect, please contact your home \nacademic department)  \n \nThe registration process can be completed within SIO (Student Information Online) by following 4 easy steps: https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/docs/4 -easy -steps.pdf\n \nIf students have any questions about course selection, students  may reach out to MIIS program \ndirector, Teruko Mitamura.  \n4.7 Drop/Add/Withdraw Procedures  \nStudents taking undergraduate and master\u2019s level courses must follow the procedures and \ndeadlines for adding, dropping, or withdrawing from courses as identified on the academic \ncalendar. Information can be found at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/course -\nchanges/index.html . P lease note that there is a separate calendar for doctoral courses that does \nnot apply to Masters\u2019 students.  \n4.8 Transfer Courses and Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE)  ", "MIIS Graduate Student Handbook  Page 18  \n Carnegie Mellon University offers students the opportunity to take courses for credit through \na cross -registration program (see Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE) and Cross -\nregistration below) and through the receipt of transfer credit from other accredited institutions. The Carnegie Mellon University transcript will include info rmation on such \ncourses as follows: Carnegie Mellon courses and courses taken through the university's cross -\nregistration program will have grades recorded on the transcript and be factored into the QPA. All other courses will be recorded on this transcript indicating where the course was taken, \nbut without grades. Such courses will not be considered for academic actions, honors or QPA \ncalculations.  \nhttps://www.cmu.edu/policies/student- and-student- life/transfer -credit -evaluation -and-\nassignment.html  \n \nNOTE: Suspended students may take courses elsewhere; however, they may receive transfer \ncredit only if their college\u2019s and department's policies allow this.  \n4.9 Internships  \nIf the experience will have units attached to it, the program should have deliverables from the \nstudent commensurate with the number of units they are taking. This can be in the form of \ninterim and final reports on the experience, presentations in the foll owing semester regarding \nthe experience, assessments of their experience as it relates to their course of study, etc. Students are responsible for identifying and applying for internships on their own.  The LTI and the university provide several types of support for students seeking internships.   \nAn annual poster session helps spread information from MIIS students that recently completed internships to MIIS students that will soon seek internships; other LTI professional master\u2019s programs have similar internship- oriented poster sessions that MIIS s tudents may attend. The \nuniversity offers resume -writing and interviewing workshops to help prepare students and fall \nand spring employment fairs to help students connect with companies.  The university\u2019s Career \n& Professional Development Center  https://www.cmu.edu/career/\n provides other services as \nwell.  \nIf a student cannot find an internship, the MIIS program will arrange an on -campus internship \nwith a university -based project.  This internship may be unpaid.  \nInternational students are required to consult with Office of International  Education for \neligibility before seeking an internship/co- op or signing an offer contract (required addition to \nensure the university is in compliance with immigration laws for F &  J status students) . \n4.10 Advising  ", "MIIS Graduate Student Handbook  Page 19  \n Each student has a faculty advisor charged with guiding the education and monitoring the \nprogress of the student through the program. The advisor also supervises the student's directed \nstudy projects. This personal student -advisor relationship ensures that  every student receives \nthe necessary faculty mentoring. The advisor also provides the student with career advice.  \nHow and when the advisor is selected:  Advisors are selected during the first month of the \nprogram. Students are expected to attend the LTI Orientation Faculty Research Talks in which faculty describe their interests and areas of expertise, and to be proactive about meeting \nindividually with potential advisors. Typically, if a student and faculty member agree to enter \nan advising relationship, it is approved by the Program Director. If a student has not found an \nadvisor after one month in the program, the Pr ogram Director will assign an advisor to the \nstudent.  \nHow to change advisors:  The initial advisor selection should be made carefully. However, it is \npossible to change advisors. To do so, the student should find another faculty member willing to serve as an advisor, and then make a request to the Program Director to switch advisors . The \nLTI follows the long -standing SCS policy that both the new and old advisors need to agree to \nthe change; typically, this is not a problem, assuming the new advisor has agreed in advance, as \ndescribed here. It is to the student' s advantage to avoid switching advisors, especially late in \ntheir graduate studies, because forging a strong student- advisor relationship takes time.  \n4.11 LTI Orientation  \nPrior to the beginning of each Fall semester the LTI provides lectures and faculty research \ntalks to help students learn about the work done by CMU faculty and to provide an \nopportunity for advisors to recruit new students.  Students are expected to attend  them and to \ntreat them as seriously as a course, because they provide a good introduction to the broad range of research done at the LTI.  Students do not have to register for the LTI Orientation \nFaculty Research Talks, nor do they receive a grade, however the department is serious about its expectation that new students will attend these talks.  \nThe LTI Orientation Canvas course\n is a mandatory course designed to increase incoming LTI \ngraduate students' awareness and understanding of CMU's community standards and the \nresources that CMU offers the students. The course includes several administrative tasks, \ntraining, and educational  sessions. The students will be enrolled into the course by the \nprogram administrator in early August. All MIIS students are expected to complete all \nassignments by the end of their first semester in the program. Each assignment has its own due \ndate.  \n4.12 Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures  \nGraduate students will find the Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance \nProcedures on the Graduate Education Resource webpage. This document summarizes ", "MIIS Graduate Student Handbook  Page 20  \n processes available to graduate students who seek review of academic and non -academic issues. \nGenerally, graduate students are expected to seek informal resolution of all concerns within the \napplicable department, unit, or program before invoking formal processes. When an informal \nresolution cannot be reached, however, a graduate student who seeks further review of the matter is to follow the formal procedures outlined here. These appeal and grievance procedures \nshall apply to students in all graduate progr ams of the University. Students should refer to the \ndepartment specific information in this handbook for department and college information about \nthe administration and academic policies of the program.\n \nSummary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures - Office of Graduate and \nPostdoctoral Affairs - Carnegie Mellon University (cmu.edu)  \n4.13 Intellectual Property Policy  \nThe MIIS degree program adheres to Carnegie Mellon University policy on intellectual \nproperty:  http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/IntellProp.html  \n5 Grad ing and Evaluation  \n5.1 Grading Scale/System  \nStudents must demonstrate their mastery of material taught in courses and their success in applying their skills in directed study and capstone projects by satisfying the following grade requirements:  \n1. Minimum grade:    A student must obtain a B - or better grade in all courses, which count \ntowards core requirements. If a student receives a C or better, that course may count as an elective towards the degree requirements . \n2. Minimum QPA :  A student must maintain an average QPA of at least 3.0 in courses and \nprojects used to satisfy degree requirements.  \n3. Pass/fail:   Pass/fail grades are not permitted for courses and projects used to satisfy a degree \nrequirement. Graduate students who are required to take additional undergraduate courses to build up the core foundations of computer science may not elect the pass/fail  option for these \ncourses.  \n5.2 Pass/Fail Grades  \nPass/fail grades are not permitted for courses used to satisfy a degree requirement, except for \nthe 11 -696 (A) Capstone Planning Seminar and 11 -935 (R) LTI Practicum that are a Pass/Fail. ", "MIIS Graduate Student Handbook  Page 21  \n Graduate students who are required to take additional undergraduate courses to build up the \ncore foundations of computer science may not elect the pass/fail option for these courses.  \n5.3 Independent Study  \nAn independent study can be counted as an Elective course, but it cannot be counted as a Qualifying course.  \n5.4 University Policy on Grades  \nThis policy offers details concerning university grading principles for students taking courses and covers the specifics of assigning and changing grades, grading options, drop/withdrawals, and course repeats.   It also defines the undergraduate and graduat e grading standards.  \nhttps://www.cmu.edu/policies/student- and-student-life/grading.html\n \n5.5 Process for Appealing Final Grades  \nFinal grades will be changed only in exceptional circumstances and only with the approval of the instructor and the department, unit or program. Grading is a matter of sound discretion of \nthe instructor and final grades are rarely changed without the consent of the instructor who \nassigned the grade. The following circumstances are the unusual exceptions that may warrant a grade appeal: (a) the final grade assigned for a course is based on manifest error ( e.g., a clear \nerror such as arithmetic error in computing a grade or failure to grade one of the answers on an exam), or (b) the faculty or staff member who assigned the grade did so in violation of a \nuniversity  policy.  \nSummary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures - Office of Graduate and \nPostdoctoral Affairs - Carnegie Mellon University (cmu.edu)  \n5.6 Policy on Grades for Transfer Courses  \nCarnegie Mellon University offers students the opportunity to take courses for credit through \na cross -registration program (see Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE) and Cross -\nregistration below) and through the receipt of transfer credit from other accredited institutions. The Carnegie Mellon University transcript will include information on such \ncourses as follows: Carnegie Mellon courses and courses taken through the university's cross -\nregistration program will have grades recorded on the transcript and be factored into the QPA. All other courses will be recorded on this transcript indicating where the course was taken, but without grade. Such courses will not be taken into account for academic actions, honors or ", "MIIS Graduate Student Handbook  Page 22  \n QPA calculations. (Note: Suspended students may take courses elsewhere; however, they may \nreceive transfer credit only if their college\u2019s and department's policies allow this.)  \nhttps://www.cmu.edu/policies/student -and-student- life/transfer -credit- evaluation -and-\nassignment.html  \n5.7 End of Semester Evaluation  \nNear the end of each semester, the student must prepare a statement that describes their achievements in the current semester and plans for the next semester. At the end of the \nsemester, the faculty evaluates each student's academic progress. The student's advisor serves \nas the student's advocate in this process. The result of the evaluation is a letter from the faculty to the student that indicates whether the student is making satisfactory progress towards \ncompleting the degree.  \nA good letter  typically indicates that the student is making satisfactory progress. If the student \nis doing exceptionally good work, a stronger adjective such as excellent  might be used, but this \nis unusual.  \nIf a student seems to be having trouble, the faculty determines whether it believes that the student can finish the degree, and if so, what needs to be accomplished to get back on track. This type of letter should be considered a serious warning. It is not  a permanent \"black mark\" \non the student's record; if the student begins making satisfactory progress again, there is no official record of the letter in the student's transcript.  \nIn the most serious cases, the faculty gives the student an N- 1 letter that specifies a list of \nconditions that the student must satisfy by specific deadlines. Failure to meet all  the specified \nconditions may result in the student's termination from the program.  \n5.8 Satisfactory Progress  \nIf a student does not make satisfactory progress each semester toward completing the degree, \nthe LTI may remove the student from the program or strongly encourage the student to consider switching to the four- semester program (MIIS -21) to complete all the requirements.  \n5.9 Academic Integrity  \nPlease review the University Policy on Academic Integrity https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student- and-student- life/academic -integrity.html. The policy \nincludes the University expectations around academic integrity and provides definitions of \ncheating, plagiarism, and unauthorized assistance.  \n ", "MIIS Graduate Student Handbook  Page 23  \n A review of the University\u2019s Academic Disciplinary Actions procedures  \nhttps://www.cmu.edu/student -affairs/theword/academic- discipline/index.html  is also \nrecommended. These procedures outline the process for investigating, reporting, and \nadjudicating violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity. The procedures also outline the appeal process.  \n \nIn the midst of self -exploration, the high demands of a challenging academic environment can \ncreate situations where some students have difficulty exercising good judgment. Academic \nchallenges can provide many opportunities for high standards to evolve if students actively \nreflect on these challenges and if the community supports discussions to aid in this process. It \nis the responsibility of the entire community to establish and maintain the integrity of our \nuniversity.  \nCarnegie Mellon University educates its students to become professionals who will serve \nsociety with integrity. The university also creates and disseminates new knowledge and \nexpressions of knowledge in ways that benefit society. Carnegie Mellon strives to serve the \nchanging needs of society through the three primary goals outlined in its mission statement: to \ncreate and disseminate knowledge and art through research and artistic expression, teaching \nand learning and transfer to society, to serve students by teaching them leadership and \nproblem -solving skills, and the values of quality, ethical behavior, responsibility to society and \ncommitments to work, to pursue the advantages provided by a diverse community, open to the \nexchange of ideas, where discovery and artistic creativity can flourish.  \nIn any presentation, creative, artistic or research, it is the ethical responsibility of each student to identify the conceptual sources of the work submitted. Failure to do so is dishonest and is \nthe basis for a charge of cheating or plagiarism, which is subject to disciplinary action.  \n \nThe university has a very clear and specific protocol for responding to alleged violations of \nacademic integrity.  Carnegie Mellon's Academic Disciplinary Actions Overview for Graduate \nStudents describes procedures for disciplinary actions against graduate students in cases of alleged violations of academic regulations and the appeal process.   \nImportant note:   The LTI implements the above policy\u2019s option of \u201cconven[ing] a disciplinary \nhearing according to the procedures of the department/program\u201d.  Our procedure is as follows: a first violation is grounds for dismissal from the graduate program.  If we decide to not \nimmediately dismiss, the first violation will result in the student being on disciplinary probation.  If a student commits a second violation while on probation, the penalty is dismissal from the graduate program.  \n6 Academic Policies  \n6.1 MIIS Academic Policies  ", "MIIS Graduate Student Handbook  Page 24  \n 6.1.1 Double  Counting Courses  \nA Masters student who uses courses taken as part of another degree program (at Carnegie \nMellon or elsewhere) toward their program requirements cannot use those same courses \ntoward any other M.S. degree offered by the School of Computer Science without prior approval. (SCS policy)  \n6.1.2 Duration of Study  \nMIIS -16 students enrolled for full- time study are expected to complete the degree in three \nsemesters of academic study and one summer internship (16 months  total).  \nMIIS -21 students  enrolled for full- time study are expected to complete the degree in four \nsemesters of academic study and one summer internship (21 months total).  \nMIIS -16 students enrolled for part -time study are expected to complete the program in six \nsemesters of academic stu dy and  one summer internship (27  months  total ).   \nMIIS -21 students enrolled for part -time study are expected to complete the program in seven \nsemesters of academic study and one summer internship (31 months total).  \nSee also the \u2018Statute of Limitations\u2019 policy.  \n6.1.3 Deferral  \nMIIS students are given the opportunity to defer their enrollment. The deferral request must be approved by the program director. The deferral can only be used once for the period of one academic year.  \n6.1.4 Maximum and Minimum Course  Loads  \nA student in the program may not take  more than sixty (60 ) units per  semester without \npermission from the program director.  \nA student in the program must be registered for a minimum  thirty -six (36) units per semester \nto be considered a full- time  student or twelve (12) units per semester to be considered a part-\ntime  student. All international students are required by US Federal law to maintain full -time \nstatus. Reduced Course Load is not permitted  for MIIS students. Failure to maintain full -time \nstatus will result in loss of a student visa (and, therefore, \u201cpermit of stay\u201d).  (MIIS policy)  \n6.1.5 Transfer Credit  \nAn equivalent graduate course previously completed at  Carnegie Mellon,  or another \ninstitution may be permitted to satisfy one of the MIIS breadth  requirements. The decision on \nwhether a course may be used to satisfy a breadth requirement is made by the MIIS Program ", "MIIS Graduate Student Handbook  Page 25  \n Director. Typically , the student will provide the Program Director with the syllabus of the \nexternal course, and the Program Director will use that and the student\u2019s transcript to make \nthe decision.  \nSatisfying a breadth requirement with a course from another institution does not reduce the number of CMU course units that must be taken to attain the MIIS degree.  \nSee the section on \u201cDefinition of transfer credit versus course exemption\u201d  on page 2 5. \n6.1.6 Transferring into the MIIS Program  \nTransfers into the MIIS program are not permitted during a student\u2019s first semester at CMU.  Students must begin their study at CMU in the program that admitted them. \nStudents may request to transfer into the MIIS program after completing their first semester \nand before the add/drop deadline of the spring semester.  The student must make the request \nin writing (or email) to the MIIS Program Director.  The MIIS Program D irector will inform \nthe student about what application materials are required, for example, an explanation of why \na transfer is desired, a proposed plan of study, a proposed advisor, and CMU transcripts.  \nStudents that are already enrolled in an LTI degree  program are not required to retake GRE \nand TOEFL /IELTS/Duolingo  exams or to produce new transcripts from other universities.   \nThe MIIS program will conduct an expedited admissions process after receiving such a request.  The program will explicitly consider whether the coursework done prior to the \ntransfer will allow the student to be \u201con schedule\u201d by the end of the spring semest er, so that \nthe student can participate in a capstone project with other MIIS students during the next fall semester.  \nMIIS students are allowed to switch tracks (MIIS -16 to MIIS -21 and vice versa) after \nbeginning their first semester at CMU. Ideally, all switch requests must be filed  within the \nfirst semester of the program. It is highly recommended to not switch tracks more than \nonce!  Though not forbidden, multiple track switching may negatively impact immigration \nrecords of international  students. Students also must  understand that extension  of their stay \nin the program will lead to additional financial obligations.   \nU.S. citizens, virtually, have no restrictions on how many times they can switch if  it is done for \na legitimate  reason. To confirm legitimacy of the reason to switch tracks  ALL  students must \nseek their advisor's approval and the approval of the Director of the MIIS program.  \n6.1.7 Transferring Out of the MIIS Program  \nThe MIIS program does not prevent students from transferring to another degree program.  Each degree program has its own rules about whether and when transfers into the program are \npermitted.  A student that is interested in transferring out of the MIIS de gree program should \nconsult the handbook and Program Director of the desired degree program to learn whether \ntransfers are permitted, and if so, how,  and when to request such a transfer.  ", "MIIS Graduate Student Handbook  Page 26  \n 6.2 LTI Academic Policies  \n6.2.1 Verification  of Enrollment  \nEnrollment Services is the only University office that can provide an official letter of \nenrollment, official transcript, and enrollment verification.  Enrollment verification can be \nrequested online through The HUB at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/student-\nrecords/verifications/enrollment.html. \n6.2.2 \u201cGrandfather\u201d poli cy \nA student can graduate under the policies in effect at the time that the student entered the \nprogram; or, at the student's choice, the student can graduate under policies that are adopted \nafter the student entered the program. If it is not realistic to fol low a particular policy exactly, \nthe department may approximate the policy as closely as possible; this situation is rare and \ntypically arises only when a student is enrolled in the program for an extended period . \n6.2.3 Time Away from Academic Responsibilities  \nGraduate students should not assume that their time -off follows the academic calendar of \ncourses. Many are coming from an undergraduate environment where their university \nemployment followed their course schedule. For many graduate degree programs, there i s an \nexpectation that graduate students continue research during academic breaks and time away \nfrom campus which may or may not be negotiated with the students. If there are requirements \nfor student time beyond a typical week day, this should be specified.  Clarify that University \nHolidays are also student holidays, and students need to consult their faculty about coverage if they have challenges with taking time off during University Holidays. For example, if \nexperiments are running that need to be monitored continuously students should speak with \ntheir faculty about arrangements to take an equal number of days off at another time.  \n6.2.4 Definition of transfer credit versus course exemption  \nThe LTI may grant transfer credit  or issue an exemption  for equivalent graduate courses \npreviously completed at another institution. This decision rests with the director  of the \nprogram . If a student is exempt  from a required course due to prior courses or experience, the \nstudent can replace that course with an open elective. The student does not receive credit for \nthe external course but  can take any course that could normally count toward the degree in its \nplace. If a student receives credit  for prior cou rsework completed at CMU or elsewhere, the \nstudent receives that many units of credit, and the total amount of required coursework is reduced by that amount.  ", "MIIS Graduate Student Handbook  Page 27  \n 6.2.5 External Employment/Consulting  \nSince the M IIS program places heavy demands on student time, external employment and/or \nconsulting are strongly discouraged. Exceptional students who wish to consult should discuss \nthis with their Advisor. International students must also have approval in advance from the \nOffice of International Education (OIE) for any outside employment.  \n6.2.6 Leave of Absence  \nThe LTI discourages Leaves of Absence (LOA), since students usually do not return, despite \ngood intentions. However, a student in good standing may be granted a LOA of at most 1 year, upon written request to the Program Director and with consent of the student's advisor. It is the responsibility of the student on LOA to contact the LTI to initiate a return to the program.  \n6.2.7 Withdrawal of a Degree  \nThe University reserves the right to withdraw a degree even though it has been granted should there be discovery that the work upon which it was based or the academic records in support \nof it had been falsified. In such a case, withdrawal of the degree will occur promptly upon \ndiscovery of the falsification. The complete reference to this University policy is available at https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student -and-student- life/withdrawal- of-a-degree.html . \n6.2.8 Winter and Summer Breaks  \nStudents supported by research projects are expected to remain on campus working during \nbreaks in classes.  A two- week vacation is typically allowed in the summer.  The normal \nwinter break policy is that the student works 40 hours per week for two weeks and  takes \nvacation for the other two weeks.  \n7 Safeguarding Educational Equity  \n7.1 Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities  \nhttp://www.cmu.edu/education- office/disability -resources/  \nThe Office of Disability Resources at Carnegie Mellon University has a continued mission \nto provide physical, digital, and programmatic access to ensure that students with disabilities have equal access to their educational experience. We work to ensure that \nqualified individuals receive reasonable accommodations as guaranteed by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.

While this handbook is specific to \nyour academic experience in the department, there are several other \nresources and offices graduate students are encouraged to consult during \ntheir tenure at Carnegie Mellon University. Information about The Word, \nthe student handbook, the Office of Graduate and Postdoctoral Affairs, the \nOffice of the Dean of Students, and others are included in Appendix A of \nthis handbook. \n1.1 The MCDS Degree \nThe MCDS Degree The Master of Computational Data Science (MCDS) \ndegree is a professional Master of Science degree offered by the Language \nTechnologies Institute (LTI), a department in the School of Computer \nScience at Carnegie Mellon University. The MCDS degree offers students \nwith a Bachelor's degree the opportunity to improve their training with \nadvanced study in Computer Science and Machine Learning. We cater to \nstudents with basic analytic skills and a strong aptitude for mathematics, \nprogramming, and logical reasoning. An undergraduate degree in \nComputer Science is not required. Most students will complete the \nprogram in three semesters; students coming from other disciplines and \nstudents focus on developing applied research skills in preparation for \nfurther graduate study or research-oriented employment may require an \nadditional fourth semester. \n \nThe MCDS Program offers a core curriculum and several concentrations; \nstudents entering the program enroll in core courses in their first \nsemester and select further courses to satisfy at least one concentration \n(see Section 3.3.6). Students construct their own course of study, in \nconsultation with their academic advisor, in order to satisfy broad \nguidelines. Thus, a student may tailor their coursework in a given \nconcentration to follow a particular area of emphasis. The MCDS program \nis typically a 16-month program consisting of courses, seminars, a \nrequired Capstone Project and a required summer internship or practical \ntraining. While some MCDS graduates continue on to PhD programs in the \nLTI or other leading universities, most graduates go on to jobs in ", " \n 7corporate research and development laboratories. \n \nThe program consists entirely of coursework and a Capstone Project, and \nno Master\u2019s Thesis is required. All Capstone projects are structured as \nresearch activities and may lead to a publication. There is no Doctoral \nprogram in Computational Data Science. Because of the highly selective \nnature of the MCDS program and quality of the MCDS curriculum, \nperforming well in the program will give a boost to a PhD application. MS \ngraduates are welcome to apply to CMU PhD programs but will not receive \npreferential treatment. \n \nThere are significant differences between CMU's different departments \nand degree programs in philosophical approach, procedures, policies and \nregulations. Each department issues a handbook that informs graduate \nstudents of their program requirements and procedures and ensures that \nstudents have written access to the standard information outlined below. \nThis handbook describes the policies, procedures, and requirements for \nthe Master of Computational Data Science (MCDS) degree. \nAll policies not explicitly described in this document conform to School of \nComputer Science (SCS) policies and university policies described in The \nWord, Carnegie Mellon University Student Handbook and at the \nUniversity Policies website. \n1.2 Vision \nCarnegie Mellon University will have a transformative impact on society \nthrough continual innovation in education, research, creativity, and \nentrepreneurship. \n1.3 Mission \nTo create a transformative educational experience  for students focused on \ndeep disciplinary knowledge; problem solving; leadership, \ncommunication, and interpersonal skills; and personal health and well-\nbeing. \nTo cultivate a transformative university community  committed to (a) \nattracting and retaining diverse, world-class talent; (b) creating a \ncollaborative environment open to the free exchange of ideas, where ", " \n 8research, creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship can flourish; and \n(c) ensuring individuals can achieve their full potential. \nTo impact society in a transformative way  \u2014 regionally, nationally, and \nglobally \u2014 by engaging with partners outside the traditional borders of the \nuniversity campus. \n1.4 MCDS Contact Information \nThe people responsible for administering the MCDS degree are: \n \nJennifer M Lucas  \nAcademic Program Manager \nMaster of Computational Data Science  \nLanguage Technologies Institute \nSchool of Computer Science  \nCarnegie Mellon University \nGates-Hillman Center 6415 \n5000 Forbes Avenue, Pgh, PA 15213 \nPhone: (412) 268-9870 \nFax: (412) 268-7287 \n  Carolyn Penstein Ros\u00e9, Director  \nMaster of Computational Data Science  \nLanguage Technologies Institute \nSchool of Computer Science \nCarnegie Mellon University \nGates-Hillman Center 5419 \n5000 Forbes Avenue, Pgh, PA 15213 \nPhone: (412) 268-4525 \nFax: (412) 268-7287 \nRobert Frederking  \nGraduate Program Chair \nLanguage Technologies Institute \nSchool of Computer Science  \nCarnegie Mellon University \nGates-Hillman Center 6515 \n5000 Forbes Avenue, Pgh, PA 15213 \nPhone: (412) 268 -6656 Mona Diab, LTI Director  \nLanguage Technologies Institute \nSchool of Computer Science  \nCarnegie Mellon University \nGates-Hillman Center 5723 \n5000 Forbes Avenue, Pgh, PA 15213 \nPhone: (412) 268-3669 \n \nThe Language Technologies Institute is located primarily on the 5th and 6th floors of the \nGates Hillman Complex (GHC) on Carnegie Mellon\u2019s Pittsburgh campus: \n \nLanguage Technologies Institute \nCarnegie Mellon University \n5000 Forbes Avenue \nGates Hillman Complex 5402, LTI \nPittsburgh, PA 15241-3891 \n \n412-268-6591 (phone) \n412-268-6298 (fax) \nhttp://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/  ", " \n 91.5 University Policies and Expectations \nEach member of the Carnegie Mellon community must be familiar with university \npolicies and guidelines.

The \nTitle IX ", " \n 10coordinator may be reached at 412-268-7125 or tix@cmu.edu . \n \n1.7 The Carnegie Mellon Code  \n \nStudents at Carnegie Mellon, because they are members of an academic community \ndedicated to the achievement of excellence, are expected to meet the highest standards \nof \npersonal, ethical and moral conduct possible. \n \nThese standards require personal integrity, a commitment to honesty without \ncompromise, as well as truth without equivocation and a willingness to place the good of \nthe community above the good of the self. Obligations once undertaken must be met, \ncommitments kept. \n \nAs members of the Carnegie Mellon community, individuals are expected to uphold the \nstandards of the community in addition to holding others accountable for said standards. \nIt is \nrare that the life of a student in an academic community can be so private that it will not \naffect the community as a whole or that the above standards do not apply. \n \nThe discovery, advancement and communication of knowledge are not possible without \na \ncommitment to these standards. Creativity cannot exist without acknowledgment of the \ncreativity of others. New knowledge cannot be developed without credit for prior \nknowledge. Without the ability to trust that these principles will be observed, an \nacademic community cannot exist. \n \nThe commitment of its faculty, staff and students to these standards contributes to the \nhigh \nrespect in which the Carnegie Mellon degree is held. Students must not destroy that \nrespect by their failure to meet these standards. Students who cannot meet them should \nvoluntarily \nwithdraw from the university. \n \nThe Carnegie Mellon Code can also be found on-line at: \nhttps://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/ . \n2 The Language Technologies Institute  \n2.1 Main Office \nThe Gates Hillman Complex: Mailboxes, printers, copiers, and other departmental \nresources are in GHC 5404. ", " \n 112.2 Photocopies and Printers \nThe use of a printer/copier requires a CS user id (see the \u2018Computers\u2019 section). The School \nof Computer Science provides several black-and-white and color printers for use by \nstudents. SCS Computing Facilities maintains a list of printers:  \nhttp://www.cs.cmu.edu/~help/printing/.  \n2.3 Office Space for MS Students \nFull-time students in the LTI\u2019s MS degree programs on the Pittsburgh campus have \naccess to a shared working space to create a sense of community and provide space for \nworking when on campus. \n2.4 Computers for MS Students \nStudents are expected to provide their own laptop computers that can be used to access \nuniversity resources and complete course assignments. Laptops running Windows, \nMacOS, and Linux software are all acceptable. \n \nMS students will be given a CS user id. A CS user id is required to use the LTI computer \ncluster, department printers, and other SCS services. The School of Computer Science \nhas a Help Center located at 4203 GHC. They can be contacted at help@cs.cmu.edu , \nextension 8-4231 from a campus phone, or 412-268-4231 from an outside line. \n \nMS students will be given access to the LTI\u2019s computer cluster on an as-needed basis, to \nbe used for course assignments, directed study projects, and/or the capstone project. The \nLTI cluster provides storage and computation for projects involving large datasets and/or \nlengthy computation.  \n3 MCDS Degree Completion and Certification  \nThis section describes the various rules and regulations that determine the attainment of \na MCDS degree by the student. \n3.1 CMU Degree Completion and Statute of Limitations \nCarnegie Mellon graduate students are expected to complete their degree requirements \nwithin the standard length of time for their program of study as outlined in the relevant \nGraduate Student Handbook. Standard program lengths for graduate students vary \nsignificantly \u2013 ranging from two semesters for some full-time master\u2019s programs to \nseveral or more years for doctoral programs. Upon completion of the graduate program \ndegree requirements, the degree will be certified by the student\u2019s academic program in \nthe semester in which the student completes the requirements. \nEarly Completion \nGraduate students who consider the completion of all degree requirements in less than \nthe standard length of time for their program of study may consult with their degree-", " \n 12granting program or department to determine if early degree certification is allowed and \nunder what circumstances. \nExtended or Longer-than-Standard Completion \nLonger-than-standard degree completion may occur due to academic interruptions in \nmaking progress toward the degree as defined by the academic program, interruptions \nof full-time study or progress towards the degree due to serious, documented medical \nissues, or other unusual or unforeseen circumstances. Master\u2019s students who require \nlonger than the standard time to complete their degree requirements are expected to \nremain in close contact with their graduate program and will be certified at the end of the \nsemester in which they have completed their degree requirements.  \nPolicy on Master\u2019s Student Statute of Limitations \nwww.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of-\nlimitations.html   \n \nSee the above link regarding guidelines and restrictions which place an upper limit on \nthe maximum length of time allowable for master\u2019s degree completion and certification. \nAdditional Guidance for Students \nProgram of study. Students seeking guidance about their program of study and degree \nrequirements should consult with their academic advisor and/or appropriate associate \ndean. \n \nFinancial aid and student account \nStudents are expected to make normal progress toward their degree to graduate within \nthe standard timeframe for their program of study. Under U.S. Federal Title IV \nregulations, student eligibility for federal financial aid is contingent upon enrollment in \nand successful completion of courses that are counted as credit toward their current \ndegree program. To receive the maximum amount of federal financial aid for which they \nmay be eligible, students must enroll each semester in at least 36 units that count toward \ntheir current degree level. (See separate guidance regarding integrated degree \ncompletion.) Students should consult with their designated college liaison in The HUB \nregarding billing and financial aid, particularly for early completion, longer-than-\nstandard completion, or integrated undergraduate and master\u2019s degree programs. \n \nInternational students   \nImmigration status for students in F-1 and J-1 non-immigrant status is tied to making \nnormal progress toward completing degree requirements. Therefore, F-1 and J-1 \nstudents who are considering completing their degree requirements early, anticipating \nlonger-than-standard completion, or moving from an undergraduate to a graduate \nstudent classification (integrated undergraduate-graduate study) should consult with \ntheir designated advisor in the Office of International Education (OIE) to ensure \ncompliance with immigration regulations. ", " \n 133.2 Full-time Status \nAll MCDS students are expected to enroll full-time (at present, there is no option to pursue \nthe degree as a part-time student). To be considered a full-time student, a student must \nbe registered for, and complete, a minimum of 36 units in every Fall and Spring semester. \nAll international students are required by US Federal law to maintain full-time status. \nStudents can have no more than one (1) remote course counting toward the 36 units used \nto satisfy full-time enrollment. Failure to maintain full-time status will result in loss of a \nstudent visa (and, therefore, \u201cpermit of stay\u201d). All students having a Stafford Loan are \nrequired to maintain full-time status. \n \n3.3 MCDS Degree Enrollment Process and Related Information \n3.3.1 Duration of the degree program \nThe MCDS degree must be completed within five (5) years from the time that the student \nmatriculates into the program. \n \nhttps://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of-\nlimitations.html  \n \nAs outlined in the Master\u2019s Students Statute of Limitations (see link above), students will \ncomplete all requirements for the master\u2019s degree within a maximum of seven years from \noriginal matriculation as a master\u2019s student, or less if required by a more restrictive \ndepartment, school or college policy. Once this time-to-degree limit has lapsed, the \nperson may resume work towards a master\u2019s degree only if newly admitted to a currently \noffered master\u2019s degree program under criteria determined by that program. \n \nUnder extraordinary circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, \nfamily or parental leave, or temporary disability, a school or college may, upon the \nrelevant department's recommendation and with the written approval of the dean (or \ndesignate), defer the lapse for a period commensurate with the duration of that \ninterruption. Students who are pursuing a master\u2019s degree as part-time students for all \nsemesters of their program, as approved by their program, may also appeal to their \nprogram or department for extension of the time to degree limit. \n \n3.3.2 Residency requirements \nThere is no formal residence requirement. However, most courses in the program are \ntaught on campus without an option for distance education. Students enrolled in in-\nperson course sections (IPR) are expected to attend all class meetings in person. \n3.3.3 Degree Certification: Course requirements and related policies/protocols ", " \n 14\uf0b7 In order to receive the MCDS degree, students must have a Quality Point Average \n(QPA) of 3.0. Completion of the degree is based on completing courses in the core \ncurriculum, the MCDS seminar, electives and capstone project. \n\uf0b7 The capstone project consists of students working at CMU on a research project, \nor on an industry-sponsored project. \n\uf0b7 The student must complete 144 eligible units of study. This includes eight core and \nconcentration courses, two 12-unit seminar courses and two 12-unit capstone \ncourses. All students complete a common MCDS core in their first two semesters, \nconsisting of five courses. All students must also complete at least one \nconcentration, consisting of three courses in one of three areas: Analytics, \nSystems, or Human-Centered Data Science. The remaining elective course can be \nany course with number 600 or above chosen from the SCS course catalog. Any \nadditional non-prerequisite units taken beyond the 144 units are also considered \nelectives. \n\uf0b7 To maintain full-time enrollment status, a student must enroll in a minimum of 36 \ncourse units per semester. A student may not take more than 60 units per \nsemester, without permission from their academic advisor. Students must \nmaintain full-time enrollment status (minimum of 36 units) in their final semester. \n3.3.4 Prerequisite Core Course \nAll MCDS students are expected to pass the 11-637 Foundations of Computational Data \nScience course by the end of their first semester. Each student must pass 11-637 with a \ngrade of \u201cB\u201d or better.  \n3.3.5 Plan of study \nThe degree consists of two timing options based on the length of time the student spends \nworking on the degree. The student chooses their timing at the start of the degree \nprogram (for visa requirements). Changes in timing are possible with the approval of the \nDirector of the degree program and successful visa extension application with CMU\u2019s \nOffice of International Education. Note that all degree options consist of the same amount \nof coursework: \n \n \n\uf0b7 Professional Preparation Track \u2013 a 16-month degree consisting of study for Fall \nand Spring semesters, a summer internship, and Fall semester of study. Each \nsemester consists of a minimum of 48 units of study. This timing is typical for most \nstudents. The student graduates in December. \n\uf0b7 Research Preparation Track \u2013 a 20-month degree consisting of study for Fall and \nSpring semesters, a summer internship, and a second year of Fall and Spring \nstudy. Each semester consists of a minimum of 36 units of study. This timing is \ndesigned for students interested in extending their time at CMU for developing \napplied research skills in preparation for further graduate study or research-\noriented employment. Note that the per-semester course load is lower, but the \ntotal cost is higher since four semesters of tuition are paid. This timing is also ", " \n 15recommended for students interested in pursuing a PhD after graduation. The \nstudent graduates in May. \n3.3.6.1 MCDS Curriculum \nAll MCDS students must complete 144 units of graduate study which satisfy the \nfollowing curriculum: \n\uf0b7 11-637 - Foundations of Computational Data Science \n\uf0b7 Four (4) additional MCDS Core Courses (10-601 Introduction to Machine \nLearning; 05-839 Interactive Data Science; 15-619 Cloud Computing; 11-631 Data \nScience Seminar; 48 units) \n\uf0b7 Three courses (3) from one area of concentration curriculum (36 units) \n\uf0b7 Three (3) MCDS Capstone courses (11-634, 11-635 and 11-632) (36 units) \n\uf0b7 One (1) Elective: any graduate level course 600 and above in the School of \nComputer Science (12 units) \n \n3.3.6.2 Common MCDS Core Courses \nAll MCDS students are required to complete four common core courses in their first two \nsemesters: \n\uf0b7 10-601 - Machine Learning \n\uf0b7 15-619 - Cloud Computing \n\uf0b7 05-839 - Interactive Data Science \n\uf0b7 11-631 - Data Science Seminar \n \n3.3.6.3 Areas of Concentration \nIn addition to the common MCDS core, all students must complete at least one area of \nconcentration, which consists of three courses in Analytics, Systems, or Human-\nCentered Data Science. Students consult with their academic advisor and choose one or \nmore areas of concentration during their first semester, in preparation for enrolling in \nSpring classes. \n \n \n\uf0b7 Analytics concentration: \no One (1) Machine Learning course \no One (1) Software Systems course \no One (1) big data course \n\uf0b7 Systems concentration: \no 15-513 Introduction to Computer Systems (elective, prerequisite for many \nadvanced Systems courses) \no Three (3) systems project courses \n\uf0b7 Human-Centered Data Science concentration: \no One (1) Methods course \no Two (2) HCI courses ", " \n 16 \nA detailed list of courses satisfying each concentration is contained in the MCDS Program \nFAQ. \n \n3.3.6.4 MCDS Capstone Courses \nAll MCDS students complete three Capstone courses: \n\uf0b7 11-634 - Capstone Planning Seminar (12 units) \n\uf0b7 11-635 - Capstone Research (12 units) \n\uf0b7 11-632 - Data Science Capstone (12 units) \n \nMCDS Program Learning Outcomes  \n \n\uf0b7 Design, implement and evaluate the use of analytic algorithms on sample \ndatasets.  \n\uf0b7 Explain how a machine-learning model is developed for and evaluated on real \nworld datasets. \n\uf0b7 Design and execute experimental data collection and present resulting analyses \nusing appropriate user experience (UX) techniques including interactive data \nvisualizations. \n\uf0b7 Apply and customize analytics, systems and human-centered data science \ntechniques to application-specific data science requirements and objectives. \n\uf0b7 Identify tradeoffs among data science techniques (analytics, systems and/or \nhuman-centered) and contrast design alternatives, within the context of specific \ndata science application domains. \n\uf0b7 Survey, interpret and comparatively criticize state of the art research talks and \npapers, with emphasis on constructive improvements. \n\uf0b7 Organize, execute, report on, and present a real world data science project in \ncollaboration with other researchers/programmers. \n \nDepending on the concentration, additional learning outcomes are emphasized: \n \nAnalytics.  Students electing to complete the Analytics concentration will also learn to:  \n \n\uf0b7 Design, implement and evaluate a software system and machine-learning model \non real world datasets at real world scale.  \n\uf0b7 Analyze and document data science requirements in different application \ndomains and survey as well as critique state of the art solutions for those \nrequirements. \n \nSystems.  Students electing to complete the Systems concentration will also learn to:  \n ", " \n 17\uf0b7 Implement and evaluate complex, scalable data science systems, with emphasis \non providing experimental evidence for design decisions. \n\uf0b7 Anticipate and avert structural and/or implementation problems with systems \ndesign, especially with scaling and tail distributions. \n \nHCDS. Students electing to complete the Human-Centered Data Science (HCDS) \nconcentration will also learn to:  \n \n\uf0b7 Design, implement and evaluate a user experience prototype to allow for clear \nunderstanding of data science solutions. \n\uf0b7 Apply social and behavioral research methods to data science problems to \nunderstand the human aspects of data collection and analysis. \n  \nThroughout their coursework, students will take introductory courses on all those topics, \npractice them in advanced courses and seminars and demonstrate all learned skills in \ntheir Capstone project and internship. Students are encouraged to choose elective \ncourses in the curriculum according to their professional goals and mastery of the main \nsubjects.  \n \n3.3.10 Capstone project \nThe capstone project consists of students working in a team or individually on a project. \nThe capstone project integrates the educational experience of the student. A capstone \nproject is typically a CMU research project, or an industry sponsored project; \noccasionally students define capstone topics through communication with the faculty. \nStudents interested in defining their own capstone topics should discuss with the MCDS \nfaculty as early as possible. The capstone project is a great opportunity for a student (or \nstudent team) to \u201cshow off\u201d their unique skills and accomplishments. Capstone projects \nhave been instrumental in the hiring decisions for several employers. \n \n \n3.3.11 Elective courses \nElectives can be any graduate level course (numbered 600 or above) in the School of \nComputer Science. Students use their elective courses to enhance study in an area of \ninterest or to explore new areas of interest. \n3.3.12 Undergraduate courses \nUndergraduate courses are taken to address an area of weakness in the student\u2019s prior \npreparation. Undergraduate courses (numbered less than or equal to 599) may be taken \npass/fail or for credit but do not count toward the 144 units of eligible study: The course \nand course grade will appear on the student\u2019s transcript, and the course grade will factor \nas part of the student\u2019s QPA. ", " \n 183.3.13 Independent study course \nIndependent study courses allow students to cover study of a particular area of interest, \nand are used when no formal course is available in a given subject area. Students who are \ninterested in continuing to a Ph.D. degree often enroll in Independent Study, since it \noffers the opportunity to perform research directly with a faculty member. Independent \nstudy courses are considered electives. \n \nEach independent study course must be advised and approved by at least one faculty \nmember. Agreement to supervise an independent study course is purely voluntary on the \npart of the faculty member. It is the duty of the student, therefore, to negotiate the terms \nand conditions of the independent study with the pertinent faculty members of CMU who \nwill be supervising the study. These individuals are referred to as \u201cindependent study \nsupervisors.\u201d Once the student finds someone who agrees to supervise such a course, \nhe/she must: \n \n \n1. Students wishing to take an independent study must request approval from their \nacademic advisor and complete proposal before the first day of classes in a given \nsemester: \n2. Enter into an agreement with the independent study supervisor that includes \ncourse expectations, including deliverables. \n3. Secure the \u201cIndependent Study Contract Form\u201d from the MCDS administrator. \n4. Complete the form, provide a brief description of the work to be done, including \ndeliverables and how they will be graded. \n5. Secure signatures of both the student and the supervisor. Return the form to the \nMCDS administrator in order to obtain approval for the independent study from the \nDirector. \n \nIndependent study contracts must be submitted no later than on the last day of the first \nweek of classes in a given semester. \n3.3.14 Double counting courses \nNo course may be used to complete two MCDS degree requirements, nor may a course \nsatisfy requirements in two degree programs. \n3.3.15 Courses outside of the School of Computer Science \nElective courses in other Schools at Carnegie Mellon may be taken with prior permission \nof the Director. \n3.3.16 Grades \nAll courses offered by the SCS CMU are graded on the 4.3 grading standard  \nhttp://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/Grades.html.  MCDS students must maintain a \n3.0 overall average each semester to remain in good standing. A student must obtain a B- \nor better grade in all courses, which count towards core requirements. If a student ", " \n 19receives a C- or better, that course may count as an elective towards the degree \nrequirements. All courses must receive a letter grade; courses taken pass/fail do not \ncount towards the MCDS degree. \n \nEnrollment Services is the only University office that can provide an official letter of \nenrollment, official transcript and enrollment verification. Enrollment verification can \nbe requested online through The HUB at: https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/student-\nrecords/verifications/  \n3.3.17 Student Review, Academic Probation and Academic Actions \nThe MCDS program conducts an academic progress review at the conclusion of each \nsemester in order to monitor individual student progress towards graduation regarding \nthe fulfillment of curricular requirements, course grades, and academic integrity. Should \na student\u2019s effort fall below the acceptable level of academic performance and/or fail to \nmeet standards and policies established by Carnegie Mellon University, the student may \nbe dismissed from the program. \n \nInfractions  \n \nAfter each academic progress review, each student will receive a letter indicating the \nresult of the review and their standing in the program. If applicable, the letter will also \nnote the following infractions by the student in the given semester: \n\uf0b7 Cumulative QPA is below 3.0, resulting in the student being put on Academic \nProbation  (see below) \n\uf0b7 Cumulative QPA is below 2.6, resulting in academic probation or possible \ndismissal (see below) \n\uf0b7 Academic Integrity Violation (AIV) deemed an infraction by the MCDS committee \n(see 3.7.2) \n \nMinimum QPA and Academic Probation  \n \nStudents must maintain a cumulative QPA of 3.0 to remain in good standing with the \nprogram. Should a student\u2019s overall QPA drop below 3.0 during any given semester, \nhe/she will be placed on academic probation  for the following semester. In probation \ncases, the student will be required to \n\uf0b7 enroll in courses as advised by the academic advisor,  \n\uf0b7 improve his/her grades to no less than an overall 3.0 QPA in the following \nsemester, and  \n\uf0b7 meet any other goal set by the advisor during that period (e.g., fulfilling a core \ncourse requirement).  \nIf a student\u2019s cumulative QPA drops below 2.6, the student will be considered at risk of \nbeing unable to complete the program and will be considered for dismissal. He/she will \nbe required to meet the program director to discuss his/her situation. Only if, after that \nmeeting, the MCDS program committee ascertains that the student is likely to complete ", " \n 20the remaining program requirements in the allotted time, the student will be allowed to \ncontinue his/her studies in MCDS, and dismissed otherwise. If the student is allowed to \ncontinue their studies, they will be placed on academic probation for the following \nsemester and is subject to the requirements above. \n \nDismissal  \n \nA student may be dismissed from the program for any of the following cases: \n\uf0b7 If the student has been put on academic probation and failed to meet the remedial \nrequirements set by the advisor in the following semester, or committed an \nAcademic Integrity Violation deemed an infraction by the MCDS committee while \non academic probation \n\uf0b7 If the student has a cumulative QPA of 2.6 or lower and the MCDS program \ncommittee does not ascertain that the student is likely to complete the remaining \nprogram requirements in the allotted time \n\uf0b7 If the student has committed two Academic Integrity Violation deemed infractions \nby the MCDS committee (see 3.7.2) \n\uf0b7 If the student has committed an Academic Integrity Violation infraction where the \nviolation is deemed to be sufficiently egregious as determined by the MCDS \nprogram committee \n\uf0b7 If the student has been found to infringe a University Policy, where such \ninfringement is deemed grounds for dismissal \n \nStudents who realize that one of these situations may apply to them are strongly \nencouraged to meet with the academic advisor to discuss a plan to mitigate the situation. \nStudents who find they are struggling in the program will have the best chances of success \nif they communicate early and often with the academic advisor. \n \n3.3.18 Incomplete grades \nCarnegie Mellon University students are expected to complete a course during the \nacademic semester in which the course was taken. However, if the instructor agrees, a \ngrade of \u201cI\u201d (incomplete) may be given when a student has been unable to complete the \nwork of a course. However, the work completed up to that date must be of passing quality \nand the grade of incomplete provides no undue advantage to that student over other \nstudents. \n \nBy awarding an \u201cI\u201d grade, an instructor must specify the requirements for the completion \nof the work and designate a default letter grade in the event that the student fails to \ncomplete the remaining work. \n \nStudents must complete the required course work by no later than the end of the \nfollowing academic semester or sooner if required by the instructor. \n ", " \n 21The instructor must record the permanent course grade by the last day of the \nexamination period of the following semester, or the Registrar will automatically assign \nthe default grade. \n \nIf further work has not been completed after one semester and a default grade is \nrendered, the default grade will become the grade of record. \n3.3.19 Change of grades and missing grades \nIf a grade has been assigned in error, it can be changed to a different permanent grade. \nThe procedure for changing a grade is as follows: \n\uf0b7 Discuss the matter with the course instructor; provide evidence that the grade issued \nwas not the grade earned. \n\uf0b7 If the instructor agrees, the student should contact the program administrator to \nprocess a Change of Grade Form in order to correct the grade that was issued in error. \nGenerally, the instructor is the final authority for a course grade. \n\uf0b7 If a grade has not been assigned, please notify the course instructor for the \ncompletion of a Missing Grade Form. \n3.3.20 Qualifying examinations and procedures (or equivalent) \nNone required. \n3.3.21 Thesis/dissertation \nNone required. \n3.3.22 On transfer to another program \nIf the requirements for the MCDS degree have not been completed when a student leaves \nto pursue another academic program, the degree will not be awarded. Completion of the \nMCDS degree does not guarantee admission into any doctoral degree program at \nCarnegie Mellon University. The courses that will be completed as part of the MCDS may \nserve to enhance one\u2019s application to these programs but will in no way insure \nadmittance. \n3.3.23 Intellectual property policy \nThe MCDS degree program adheres to Carnegie Mellon University policy on intellectual \nproperty: http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/IntellProp.html  \n3.3.24 Teaching requirements \nNone required. However, students are encouraged to apply for teaching assistant \npositions in courses where they have excelled. \n3.3.25 Language proficiency requirements \nNone required. However, non-native English speakers are encouraged to take advantage \nof the various support functions provided by the Intercultural Communication Center \n(ICC) and the Global Communication Center (GCC). ", " \n 223.3.26 Academic Integrity and Policies on Plagiarism and Cheating \nThe university considers any form of cheating or plagiarism to be a serious violation of \nstudent ethics. The student is required to understand and rigorously follow only the \npermitted forms of collaboration as defined by the instructor in every class. The work \nyou submit must be your own, unless you have clearly attributed it to others. You must \nnot use the work of others without proper citation. And, you must not use resources, \nincluding other persons, except as authorized by the course or project for which you are \nsubmitting the work. Such conduct might be accepted or commonplace elsewhere, but it \nis not here. Be careful. Be warned. Failure to abide by these rules, even just once, can \nresult in your permanent separation from the University without refund of money paid. \nNote that the policy requires the student to be informed and understand the academic \nintegrity rules for every assignment or exam in a course. \n \nThe MCDS program strives to produce graduates with the highest standards of academic \nintegrity. Academic Integrity Violations are taken very seriously and the MCDS program \nhas a zero tolerance policy for multiple Academic Integrity Violations. A single violation \nis grounds for dismissal from the graduate program if deemed sufficiently egregious as \ndetermined by the MCDS program committee. If a student commits a second violation, \nthe expected penalty is dismissal from the graduate program (see also academic progress \nreview at section 3.3.17). \n \nPlease review the University Policy on Academic Integrity: \nhttps://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html   \nThe policy includes the University expectations around academic integrity and \nprovides definitions of cheating, plagiarism, and unauthorized assistance. \n \nA review of the University\u2019s Academic Disciplinary Actions procedures \nhttps://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/academic-discipline/index.html   is also \nrecommended. These procedures outline the process for investigating, reporting, and \nadjudicating violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity. The procedures \nalso outline the appeal process. \n \n3.3.27 Process for Appealing Final Grades  \nhttps://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/academic/appeal-of-grades-and-academic-actions.html  \n \nFinal grades will be changed only in exceptional circumstances and only with the \napproval of the instructor and the department, unit or program. Grading is a matter of \nsound discretion of the instructor and final grades are rarely changed without the consent \nof the instructor who assigned the grade. The following circumstances are the unusual \nexceptions that may warrant a grade appeal: (a) the final grade assigned for a course is \nbased on manifest error (e.g. a clear error such as arithmetic error in computing a grade \nor failure to grade one of the answers on an exam), or (b) the faculty or staff member who \nassigned the grade did so in violation of a University policy. ", " \n 233.3.27 Teaching Assistants \nThe MCDS degree does not have a teaching requirement. However, some students may \nwish to be a teaching assistant. MCDS students may petition for approval to TA up to one \ncourse per semester provided that they are in good academic standing (Overall QPA 3.0 \nor above). \n \nAs required by the English Fluency in Higher Education Act of 1990, graduate students \nare required to have a certain level of fluency in English before they can instruct in \nPennsylvania. Through this Act, all institutions of higher education in the state are \nrequired to evaluate and certify the English fluency of all instructional personnel, \nincluding teaching assistants and interns. \n \nThe full university policy can be reviewed at: \n \nhttp://www.cmu.edu/policies/faculty/evaluation-certification-english-fluency-\ninstructors.html . \n \nIn addition to administering the International Teaching Assistant (ITA) Test (mandatory \nscreening test for any non-native speaker of English), Language Support in the Student \nAcademic Success Center helps teaching assistants who are non-native English speakers \ndevelop fluency and cultural understanding to teach successfully at Carnegie Mellon. \nVisit the website for additional information: https://www.cmu.edu/student-success/  \n3.3.28 Internship Requirement and Search for Full Time Employment \nAn internship is required for the degree program. In some cases, when a student has \nprior work experience, the Director of the degree program may waive this requirement. \nStudents start searching for internships generally in the Fall and Spring semesters. Once \nthe student returns from an internship in the Fall, they should immediately begin the \nsearch for full time employment. Extensive resources are available at \nhttp://www.cmu.edu/career/  including a resume submission system, a list of employers, \non campus interviews and mock interviews, and many other resources. \n \nThe Technical Opportunities Conference (TOC) \nhttp://engineering.cmu.edu/companies/toc/  occurs every September. This conference is \none of the main recruiting events each year. \n \nAll international students are required to apply for Curricular Practical Training (CPT). \nCPT is employment that is an integral part of an established curriculum and is directly \nrelated to the student\u2019s major area of study. Please visit the Office of International \nEducation (OIE) link below to learn more about the CPT process: \nhttp://www.cmu.edu/oie/forstu/jobs.html   \n ", " \n 243.4 Enrollment Verification \nEnrollment Services is the only University office that can provide an official letter of \nenrollment, official transcript and enrollment verification. Enrollment verification can \nbe requested online through The HUB via this link: \nhttp://www.cmu.edu/hub/transcripts/verifications/enrollment.html  \n \n \n3.5 University Policies on Grades and Grading \n3.6.1 University Policy on Grades \nThis policy offers details concerning university grading principles for students taking \ncourses and covers the specifics of assigning and changing grades, grading options, \ndrop/withdrawals and course repeats. It also defines the undergraduate and graduate \ngrading standards. \n \nYou can review the university grading policies here: \nhttps://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/grading.html   \n3.6.2 University Policy on Grades for Transfer Courses \nCarnegie Mellon University offers students the opportunity to take courses for credit \nthrough a cross-registration program (see Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education \n(PCHE) and Cross-registration below) and through the receipt of transfer credit from \nother accredited institutions. The Carnegie Mellon University transcript will include \ninformation on such courses as follows: Carnegie Mellon courses and courses taken \nthrough the university\u2019s cross-registration program will have grades recorded on the \ntranscript and be factored into the QPA. All other courses will be recorded on this \ntranscript indicating where the course was taken, but without grades. Such courses will \nnot be taken into account for academic actions, honors or QPA calculations. (Note: \nsuspended students may take courses elsewhere; however, they may receive transfer \ncredit only if their college\u2019s and department\u2019s policies allow this.) \n \nYou can review the university policy here: \nhttps://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/transfer-credit-evaluation-and-\nassignment.html   \n \n3.6 Academic Integrity \n3.7.1 Expectations Regarding Proper Conduct \nIn the midst of self-exploration, the high demands of a challenging academic \nenvironment can create situations where some students have difficulty exercising good \njudgment. Academic challenges can provide many opportunities for high standards to \nevolve if students actively reflect on these challenges and if the community supports ", " \n 25discussions to aid in this process. It is the responsibility of the entire community to \nestablish and maintain the integrity of our university.  \n \nCarnegie Mellon University educates its students to become professionals who will serve \nsociety with integrity. The university also creates and disseminates new knowledge and \nexpressions of knowledge in ways that benefit society. Carnegie Mellon strives to serve \nthe changing needs of society through the three primary goals outlined in its mission \nstatement: to create and disseminate knowledge and art through research and artistic \nexpression, teaching and learning and transfer to society, to serve students by teaching \nthem leadership and problem-solving skills, and the values of quality, ethical behavior, \nresponsibility to society and commitments to work, to pursue the advantages provided by \na diverse community, open to the exchange of ideas, where discovery and artistic \ncreativity can flourish. \n \nIn any presentation, creative, artistic or research, it is the ethical responsibility of each \nstudent to identify the conceptual sources of the work submitted. Failure to do so is \ndishonest and is the basis for a charge of cheating or plagiarism, which is subject to \ndisciplinary action.  \n \nPlease review the University Policy on Academic Integrity \n(https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html ). The \npolicy includes the University expectations around academic integrity and provides \ndefinitions of cheating, plagiarism, and unauthorized assistance. \n \nA review of the University\u2019s Academic Disciplinary Actions procedures \n(https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/academic-discipline/index.html ) is also \nrecommended. These procedures outline the process for investigating, reporting, and \nadjudicating violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity. The procedures \nalso outline the appeal process. \n \n3.7.2 Protocol for Academic Integrity Violations \nThe university has a very clear and specific protocol for responding to alleged violations \nof academic integrity. Carnegie Mellon's Academic Disciplinary Actions Overview for \nGraduate Students describes procedures and the appeal process for disciplinary actions \nagainst graduate students in cases of alleged academic integrity violation. \n \nFor more information on disciplinary actions please see: \n \nhttps://www.cmu.edu/student-\naffairs/theword/acad_standards/creative/disciplinary.html  \n \nFurther documentation on how to respond to an allegation of a violation as a graduate \nstudent: ", " \n 26 \nhttps://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/ocsi/academic-integrity/grads.html   \n \nImportant Note: MCDS implements the above policy\u2019s option of \u201cconven[ing] a \ndisciplinary hearing according to the procedures of the department/program\u201d. We have \nadopted the following hearing procedure and \u201ctwo strikes\u201d rule: \n\uf0b7 If an instructor determines that an academic integrity violation has occurred, \nboth the instructor and students are given the opportunity to explain the situation \nto the MCDS program committee. A written hearing by email suffices for this \npurpose. \n\uf0b7 The program committee then reviews all information and decides whether the \nviolation is deemed an infraction (see 3.3.17), and which secondary actions are to \nbe taken on the program level. \n\uf0b7 Two-Strike-Rule: MCDS may dismiss students upon a first AIV infraction. A \nsecond infraction will always lead to the offending student being dismissed from \nthe program, with no exceptions. \n \nThe MCDS program reserves the right to withdraw a degree even though it has been \ngranted should there be discovery that the work upon which it was based or the academic \nrecords in support of it had been falsified. In such a case, the degree will be withdrawn \npromptly upon discovery of the falsification. The complete reference to this university \npolicy is available at:  https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-\nlife/withdrawal-of-a-degree.html  \n4 Academic Policies \n4.1 MCDS Academic Policies \n4.1.1 Duration of Study \nMCDS students enrolled for full-time studies are normally expected to complete the \ndegree in three semesters (16 months). This includes a summer internship. \n4.1.2 Double-Dipping \nA Masters student who uses courses taken as part of another degree program (at \nCarnegie Mellon or elsewhere) toward their program requirements cannot use those \nsame courses toward any other M.S. degree offered by the School of Computer Science \nwithout prior approval. \n4.1.3 Pass/Fail and Audit Grades \nPass/fail and audit grades are not permitted for courses used to satisfy a degree \nrequirement. Graduate students who are required to take additional undergraduate \ncourses to build up the core foundations of computer science may not elect the pass/fail \nor audit option for these courses. ", " \n 274.1.4 Transfer Credit \nAn equivalent graduate course previously completed at Carnegie Mellon, or another \ninstitution, may be permitted to satisfy one of the MCDS course requirements, with \npermission from the Director. Students must petition for transfer credit by providing \nthe Program Director with the prior course syllabus and other details that may be \nrequired by the Director in order to make a decision. See the section on \u201cDefinition of \ntransfer credit versus course exemption\u201d. NOTE: In all cases, credit may only be \ntransferred from another degree program for courses deemed \u201cfree electives\u201d - i.e., \ncourses which were not used to satisfy a core requirement or total units requirement in \na prior degree program. \n \nAll MS students are required to take a minimum of 96 units of coursework at CMU. \n4.1.5 External Internships and Job Interviewing \nMCDS students are expected to attain an external internship during the summer. \nInternational students must coordinate carefully with the University, due to visa \nrestrictions. International students are required to consult with the Office of \nInternational Education for eligibility before seeking an internship/co-op or signing an \noffer contract. \n \nWe caution all students to be aware of potential intellectual property (IP) implications \nwith internships, and to review any IP agreements with their academic advisor before \nsigning them. It is possible to lose ownership of your own inventions if they occur during \nan external internship. \n \nWhile it is necessary for students to travel off-campus for job interviews, it is not \nacceptable for a student to miss a course requirement or a capstone project commitment \ndue to interview travel. Students should work proactively with prospective employers to \narrange interview travel in a way that minimizes the impact on their final semester \ncourse work. \n4.1.6 Transferring into the MCDS Program \nDirect transfers into the MCDS program are not permitted. Students who are currently \nenrolled at Carnegie Mellon who wish to transfer into the MCDS program must do so by \napplying to the MCDS program via the normal admissions process. As specified in Sec. \n4.1.4 in this document, some transfer credit and/or exemption from MCDS requirements \nmay be possible on a case-by-case basis. \n4.1.7 Transferring Out of the MCDS Program \nThe MCDS program does not prevent students from transferring to another degree \nprogram. Each degree program has its own rules about whether and when transfers into \nthe program are permitted. A student that is interested in transferring out of the MCDS \ndegree program should consult the handbook and Program Director of the desired ", " \n 28degree program to learn whether transfers are permitted, and if so, how and when to \nrequest such a transfer. \n4.1.8 Statute of Limitations \nhttps://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of- \nlimitations.html   \n \nAs outlined in the Master\u2019s Students Statute of Limitations (link above), students will \ncomplete all requirements for the master\u2019s degree within a maximum of seven years \nfrom original matriculation as a master\u2019s student, or less if required by a more restrictive \ndepartment, school or college policy. Once this time-to-degree limit has lapsed, the \nperson may resume work towards a master\u2019s degree only if newly admitted to a currently \noffered master\u2019s degree program under criteria determined by that program. \n \nUnder extraordinary circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, \nfamily or parental leave, or temporary disability, a school or college may, upon the \nrelevant department's recommendation and with the written approval of the dean (or \ndesignate), defer the lapse for a period commensurate with the duration of that \ninterruption. Students who are pursuing a master\u2019s degree as part-time students for all \nsemesters of their program, as approved by their program, may also appeal to their \nprogram or department for extension of the time to degree limit. \n4.2 LTI Academic Policies \n4.2.1 \u201cGrandfather\u201d policy \nA student can graduate under the policies in effect at the time that the student entered \nthe program; or, at the student's choice, the student can graduate under policies that are \nadopted after the student entered the program. In unusual cases, the Director may \napprove exceptions to the program requirements. \n4.2.2 Course Drop/Add/withdrawal procedures \nStudents taking undergraduate and Master\u2019s level courses must follow the procedures and \ndeadlines for adding, dropping, or withdrawing from courses as identified on the \nacademic calendar. Information can be found at: \n https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/course-changes/index.html . \n \nThere is a separate calendar for masters level courses.  \n \n4.2.3 Courses with restricted enrollment \nMCDS students have priority for the program core courses. The MCDS program \nadministrators cannot intercede with other departments to secure seats for its students \nin other courses as all departments reserve seats for their accepted students. Usually all \nremaining open seats are assigned on a first- come, first-served basis.  Students can, ", " \n 29on occasion, contact the assigned course instructor in order to plead his/her case for \nadmission to the course. Admission may be granted at the discretion of the instructor. \nThe policy of the department offering the course(s) is always followed. \n4.2.4 Definition of transfer credit versus course exemption \nThe LTI may grant transfer credit or issue an exemption for equivalent graduate courses \npreviously completed at another institution. This decision rests with the Director of the \nparticular program. If a student is exempt from a required course due to prior courses or \nexperience, the student can replace that course with an open elective. The student does \nnot receive credit for the external course but can take any course that could normally \ncount toward the degree in its place. If a student receives credit for prior coursework \ncompleted at CMU or elsewhere, the student receives that many units of credit, and the \ntotal amount of required coursework is reduced by that amount. \n4.2.5 External Employment/Consulting \nSince the MCDS program places heavy demands on student time, external employment \nand/or consulting are strongly discouraged. Exceptional students who wish to consult \nshould discuss this with their advisor. International students must also have approval in \nadvance from the Office of International Education (OIE) for any outside employment. \n4.2.6 Leave of Absence \nA student in good standing may be granted a LOA of at most 1 year, upon written request \nto the Program Director and with consent of the student's advisor. It is the responsibility \nof the student on LOA to contact the program administrator to apply for a return to the \nprogram. \n4.2.7 Withdrawal from Program \nStudents may voluntarily withdraw from the MCDS program. If a student decides to \nwithdraw, or is considering a withdrawal, she/he should contact the program \nadministrator to schedule an advising meeting as soon as possible.  \n \nThe university\u2019s general withdrawal policy can be found here: \n \nhttps://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/leaves-and-withdrawals/   \n4.2.8 Satisfactory Progress \nIf a student does not make satisfactory progress each semester toward completing the \ndegree, the LTI may remove the student from the program. See section on \u201cEnd of \nSemester Evaluation\u201d. In particular, students in the three-semester program who fail one \nof their first-semester MCDS core required courses are strongly encouraged to consider \nswitching to the four-semester program. \n4.2.9 Winter and Summer Breaks ", " \n 30Students supported by research projects or working in an on-campus internship are \nexpected to remain on campus working during breaks in classes. A two-week vacation is \ntypically allowed in the summer for the students who are working on campus (not \npursuing an external internship). Supported students should arrange their winter break \ntime with their supervisor. \n \n4.3 CMU Academic Policies  \n4.3.1 Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities  \nhttp://www.cmu.edu/education-office/disability-resources/   \nThe Office of Disability Resources at Carnegie Mellon University has a continued mission \nto provide physical, digital, and programmatic access to ensure that students with \ndisabilities have equal access to their educational experience. We work to ensure that \nqualified individuals receive reasonable accommodations as guaranteed by the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. \nStudents who would like to receive accommodations can begin the process through \nDisability Resources' secure online portal  \n(https://rainier.accessiblelearning.com/cmu/ ) or email access@andrew.cmu.edu to \nbegin the interactive accommodation process. \n \nStudents with physical, sensory, cognitive, or emotional disabilities are encouraged to \nself-identify with the Office of Disability Resources and request needed accommodations. \nAny questions about the process can be directed to access@andrew.cmu.edu, or call (412) \n268-6121. \n4.3.2 Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures  \nGraduate students will find the Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance \nProcedures on the Graduate Education Resource webpage. This document summarizes \nprocesses available to graduate students who seek review of academic and non-academic \nissues. Generally, graduate students are expected to seek informal resolution of all \nconcerns within the applicable department, unit or program before invoking formal \nprocesses. When an informal resolution cannot be reached, however, a graduate student \nwho seeks further review of the matter is to follow the formal procedures outlined here. \nThese appeal and grievance procedures shall apply to students in all graduate programs \nof the University. Students should refer to the department specific information in this \nhandbook for department and college information about the administration and \nacademic policies of the program.  \n \nYou can review a summary of the university\u2019s graduate student\u2019s appeal and grievance \nprocedures here: \nhttps://www.cmu.edu/graduate/policies/appeal-grievance-procedures.html  \n4.3.3 Safeguarding Educational Equity: Sexual Harassment and Sexual Assault  ", " \n 31The University prohibits sex-based discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault, \ndating/ domestic violence and stalking.

Being in the CMU School of Computer Science (SCS) \nis a unique experience because of the size of the school (over 2000 students, staff and faculty), \nthe quality of its members, the variety of research being conducted, and unparalleled learning \nopportunities.  We encourage you to take adva ntage of CMU offerings, both inside and outside \nSCS, and also to explore Pittsburgh and southw est Pennsylvania to the extent your schedule \npermits.   What you will find is an environm ent that encourages and rewards hard work and \naccomplishment.  Pittsburgh has long been an indu strial area whose residents build things.  In \nSCS we build things, and you will also.  \nWhile this handbook is specific to your academic ex perience in the MSAII program, there are \nseveral other resources and offices graduate students are encouraged to consult during their \ntenure at Carnegie Mellon University. Infor mation about The Word, the student handbook, the \nOffice of Graduate and Postdoc A ffairs, the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs and others are \nincluded in Appendix A of this handbook. \n2 Mission, Vision and Philosophy \nCarnegie Mellon University will have a transfor mative impact on society through continual \ninnovation in education, research, creativity, and entrepreneurship. \nOur mission is to create a transformative educatio nal experience for students focused on deep \ndisciplinary knowledge; problem solving; teamwork, leadership, communication, and \ninterpersonal skills; and pers onal health and well-being. \nThe university community is committed to (a) at tracting and retaining diverse, world-class \ntalent; (b) creating a collaborative environment open to the free exchange of ideas, in which \nresearch, creativity, innovation, and entrepreneu rship can flourish; and (c) ensuring individuals \ncan achieve their full potential. \nWe encourage our members to impact society in  a transformative way \u2014 regionally, nationally, \nand globally \u2014 by engaging with partners out side the traditional bor ders of the university \ncampus.  See the full university mission statement . \n3 Carnegie Mellon Statement of Assurance \nCarnegie Mellon University does not discriminate  in admission, employment or administration \nof its programs or activities on the basis of r ace, color, national origin, sex, handicap or \ndisability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity , religion, creed, ancestry , belief, veteran status \nor genetic information. Furthe rmore, Carnegie Mellon University does not discriminate and is \nrequired not to discriminate in violation of fede ral, state or local laws or executive orders. ", "7 \n\u00a0Inquiries concerning the application of and comp liance with this statemen t should be directed \nto the university ombudsperson, Carnegie Mellon  University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, \nPA 15213, telephone 412-268-1018. Obtain genera l information about Carnegie Mellon University \nby calling 412-268-2000. \nCarnegie Mellon University publishes an annual  campus security and fire safety report \ndescribing the university's security , alcohol and drug, sexual assault and fire safety policies, and \ncontaining statistics about the number and ty pe of crimes committed on the campus, and the \nnumber and cause of fires in campus residence faci lities during the preceding three years. You \ncan obtain a copy by contacting the Carnegie Mellon Police Department  at 412-268-2323. The \nannual security and fire safety re port also is available online at \nwww.cmu.edu/police/annualreports .. \nInformation regarding the application of Title  IX, including to admission and employment \ndecisions, the sexual misconduct grievance proced ures and process, including how to file a \nreport or a complaint of sex discrimination, how to file a report of sexual harassment, and how \nthe university responds to su ch reports is available at www.cmu.edu/title-ix . The Title IX \ncoordinator may be reached at 4615 Forbes Ave, Suite 330, Pittsburgh, PA 15213; 412-268-7125; or \ntix@cmu.edu . \n4 Carnegie Mellon Code \nStudents at Carnegie Mellon, because they are members of an academic community dedicated to \nthe achievement of excellence, are expected to m eet the highest standards of personal, ethical \nand moral conduct possible. \nThese standards require personal  integrity, a commitment to honesty without compromise, as \nwell as truth without equivocation and a willingne ss to place the good of the community above \nthe good of the self. Obligations once un dertaken must be me t, commitments kept. \nAs members of the Carnegie Mellon community , individuals are expected to uphold the \nstandards of the community in a ddition to holding others accountable for said standards. It is \nrare that the life of a student in an academic community can be so private that it will not affect the community as a whole or that the above standards do not apply. \nThe discovery, advancement, and communicatio n of knowledge are not possible without a \ncommitment to these standards. Creativity cannot exist without acknowledgment of the \ncreativity of others. New knowledge cannot be developed without credit  for prior knowledge. \nWithout the ability to trust that these princ iples will be observed, an academic community \ncannot exist. \nThe commitment of its faculty, staff, and students to these standards contributes to the high \nrespect in which the Carnegie Mellon degree is he ld. Students must not de stroy that respect by ", "8 \n\u00a0their failure to meet these standards. Stud ents who cannot meet them should voluntarily \nwithdraw from the university. \nThe Carnegie Mellon Code can also be found online . \n5 University Policies and Expectations \nIt is the responsibility of each member of the Ca rnegie Mellon community to be familiar with \nuniversity policies and guidelines.

A copy of this handbook is also available online at the \nprogram website .   \nThe University Student guide, The Word, which  details university-wide policies, is also \navailable online at www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword .     \nAdditional resources specific to gr aduate students can be found at \nwww.cmu.edu/graduate/policies/     \n8.1 The MSAII Degree \nThe M.S. in Artificial Intelli gence and Innovation (MSAII) is a professional master's program \noffered by the Language Technologies Institute (LTI) in the School of Computer Science at \nCarnegie Mellon University. This program seeks to educate students in the innovative use of \nartificial intelligence to create practical soluti ons in a wide variety of application areas. As \nartificial intelligence matures, th ere is a great need for students who can envision, design, plan \nand deliver solutions that integrate AI technolo gies such as deep learning, natural language \nprocessing, robotics and big data analytics into  new applications.  The program stresses both ", "10 \n\u00a0intrapreneurship and entrepreneurship and enco urages students to develop ideas for startups \nand for introduction into established companies. \nThe curriculum is designed for students who have  a strong background in computer science \nwith interest in in-depth study of AI to ena ble them to develop re al-world applications, \nespecially in areas to which AI has not yet b een applied. The integrated curriculum includes \ncoursework and team projects lead ing to a full-semester capstone project to produce a working \nprototype.     \n8.2 Program Contacts \nMichael I.

The faculty  do not burden the students with numerous \nrules, and, in return, we expect the students to not try to find technical  loopholes that violate \nthe clear intent of program policies.  In any situa tion not covered by an ex plicit rule, you should \nask yourself how reasonable people would behave  in that situation.  The RPP does not alter \nUniversity-wide policies. \n8.4 Academic Calendar ", "11 \n\u00a0The Academic Calendar can be found at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/calendar/index.html  and \nprovides information on all deadl ines including registration date s, class start dates, add/drop \ndeadlines, exam dates and more. \n9 The Language Techno logies Institute \n9.1 Working Space for MS Students \nExcept for restrictions due to COVID, full-time students in the LTI\u2019s MS degree programs on the \nPittsburgh campus have access to a shared working space to create a sense of community and \nprovide space for working when on campus. \n9.2 Photocopies and Printers \nMailboxes, printers, copiers, and other depa rtmental resources are located in GHC 5404 \nThe use of a photocopier requires only a CMU ID card.  The School of Computer Science \nprovides a number of black-and-white and co lor printers for use by students.  The SCS \nComputer Facilities publishes a list of printers online at https://computing.cs.cmu.edu/desktop/printing.  Wh en you send a file to  the print queue, you \nmay go to any of the listed printers, swipe yo ur CMU ID, and the file will be printed on that \nprinter. \n9.3 Computers for MS Students \nStudents are expected to provide their own laptop computers that can be used to access \nuniversity resources and complete course assignm ents.  Laptops running  Windows, MacOS, and \nLinux software are all acceptable. \nMS students will be given a CS user id.  A CS us er id is required to use the LTI computer cluster, \ndepartment printers, and other SC S services.  The School of Computer Science has a Help \nCenter located at 4203 GHC.  They can be contacted at help@cs.cmu.edu , extension 8-4231 from \na campus phone, or 412-268-4 231 from an outside line. \nMS students will be given access to the LTI\u2019s comp uter cluster on an as-needed basis, to be used \nfor course assignments, directed study projects, and/or the capstone project.  The LTI cluster \nprovides storage and computation for projects  involving large datasets and/or lengthy \ncomputation.  ", "12 \n\u00a010 Degree Requirements \nMSAII students are expected to complete their degr ee requirements within five consecutive semesters, \nfall, spring, summer internship, second fall, second sp ring.  Under exceptional conditions, such as for \nmedical reasons, a student may be granted a leave of absence.  See Section 11.1.10, below.   Upon \ncompletion of the graduate program degree requirem ents, the degree will be certified by the student\u2019s \nacademic program in the semester in whic h the student completes the requirements .\u00a0\n10.1 Course Grade and GPA Requirements   \nTo receive the M.S. degree, all students  must take and successfully complete at least 195 units \nof coursework . All required Core Courses must be completed with a grade of B or better . For \nthe Knowledge Area Courses, students must maintain a B average .  No grade lower than C (or \nPass in the case of Pass/No Pass courses) shall be used for credit appli ed toward graduation.  \nUnder SCS policy, only a grade of C or higher will be regarded as a Pass in a Pass/No Pass \ncourse.  No undergraduat e courses count toward the 195-unit requirement. \nAll Core courses are organized in sequence, and must be taken in the following order: \n\uf0b7 Artificial Intelligence and Future Markets (11-651) \u2013 No prerequisite. \n\uf0b7 AI Engineering (11-695) \u2013 Prerequisite is the co mpletion of 11-651 with a grade of \u201cB\u201d or \nbetter. \n\uf0b7 LTI Practicum (11-935) \u2013 Three credit units for completing the required Internship. \n\uf0b7 AI Innovation (11-654) \u2013 Prereq uisite is the completion of 11- 695 with a grade of \u201cB\u201d or \nbetter. \n\uf0b7 Capstone (11-699) \u2013 Prerequisite is the completion of 11-654 with a grade of \u201cB\u201d or better.  \nStudents are required to repeat any required cour se that they have completed with a grade less \nthan the required minimum, preferably at the nex t offering. (Please note that Core courses and \nKnowledge courses are only offered once per year.) Students will be  allowed to retake a required \ncourse only once.  If a student fails in the second attemp t, he or she will be dropped from the \nMSAII program.    \nIf a student fails an elective course, she or he will need to repeat the same or take a substitute \ncourse (equivalent course approved by the Director).    \nAll grades count towards the program QPA, exce pt for repeated courses, in which case the final \ngrade replaces the previous grade.  Courses taken pass/no pass do not affect the student\u2019s QPA.  \nHowever, ONLY ELECTIVE COURSES MAY BE  TAKEN PASS/NO PASS, unless the Provost \ndirects to the contrary.  Students who do not achieve the required minimum grade in a required \ncourse, who elect to take an \u201ci ncomplete\u201d in a required course, or whose cumulative grade point \naverage is below a B (3.0), will be placed on academ ic probation. Students on probation are not \neligible to graduate. Students who are placed on academic probation shall receive written  \nnotice of this finding, including a list of meas ures that need to be tak en to be removed from ", "13 \n\u00a0academic probation. A student on academic pr obation for two consecutive semesters may be \ndropped from the program.    \nThe MSAII program conducts an academic progress re view at the conclusion of each semester in \norder to monitor individual student progress towa rd graduation. Should a student\u2019s effort fall \nbelow the acceptable academic performance and/or fail to meet the sta ndards established by the \nMSAII program and Carnegie Mellon Universit y, the student may be dismissed from the \nprogram. \nShould a student\u2019s overall QPA drop below 3.0 d uring any given semester, he/she will be placed \non academic probation for the following semester and will be required to improve his/her grades \nto no less than overall 3.0 QPA d uring that period. Failure to im prove to an overall 3.0 QPA or \nbetter the following semester may result in termin ation from the program. In addition, a student \nwho violates policies established by Carnegie  Mellon University may be dismissed from the \nprogram. \nAfter each academic progress revi ew, a student may receive one or  more letters, indicating the \nresult of the review. Warning letters  are issued for the following cases: \n1) Overall QPA below 3.0 (Academic probation) \n2) Semester QPA is below 3.0 \n3) Grade below B in a Core course \n4) Academic Integrity Violation (AIV) according to  the university policies.  This includes any \nAIV letter received in during the summer preceding matriculation. \nA student may be terminated from the program under any of the following circumstances: \na) A student who has received two Academic  Integrity Violation (AIV) letters will  be \nterminated.  There are no exceptions  and the Program Director has no discretion over \nsuch a termination as it is an LTI policy. \nb) A student who has received one Academ ic Integrity Violation (AIV) letter may  be \nterminated by the Program Director if the vi olation is so serious that the student cannot \nbe allowed to remain in the MSAII Program. \nc) A student has received three warning letter s of any type from the MSAII program. \nd) A student has been found to have violated a University Policy for which termination is \nprovided. \nAn AIV letter or violation of University Poli cy may be appealed pursuant to CMU appeal \nprocedures.  See Section 4.5.2, be low.  However, a decision to te rminate a student after appeal \nbecause of conditions a), b), c) or d) is not appealable. \n10.2 Course Requirements  ", "14 \n\u00a01) Summer Before Entrance  \nAdmitted students are required to take, pa y for, and pass 15-513 Introduction to \nComputer Systems OR 11-637 Foundations of Computational Data Science during the \nsummer prior to their arrival at Carnegie Mellon.  The units earned in these courses are \nnot counted toward the total number of units required for graduation.  These courses \nmay be taken pass/no pass, but cannot be dr opped.  A student who drops either course \nduring the summer will not be permitted to begin the degree program in the fall, but \nmust retake one of the courses the following summer.   The MSAII course offerings are \navailable at msaii.cs.cmu.edu/curriculum .  The university\u2019s complete Schedule of \nClasses can be found at https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/o pen/SOC/SOCServlet/search . \nStudents are then required to take and su ccessfully complete the courses below: \n2) The Core Courses (87 units) - Must be taken in THIS SEQUENCE: \n \n11-651 \u2013 AI & Future Markets \u2013 (12 units).

First spring semester. \n \n11-611, Natural Language Processing (12 units).  Second fall semester. \n 11-785, Deep Learning (12 unit s).  Second spring semester. \n One more 12-unit AI, ML or NLP course of the student\u2019s choice (with approval of the \nProgram Director) \nIn the event that a course is not available, a course covering equivalent material with a \nsimilar degree of difficulty may be substitut ed with the permission of the Director. If a ", "15 \n\u00a0student has already taken an equivalent course and shows proficiency in the subject \narea, a more advanced course in the area may be taken in place of these required \ncourses with permission of the Director.  Graduate students cannot receive credit for \nundergraduate courses.       \n \n4) Electives:  \nA minimum of 36 units of SCS courses must be taken.  It is recommended to take one \nelective in the first fall semester, one or tw o in the first spring semester, one or two in \nthe second fall semester and zero or one in the second spring semester.  The courses \nbelow are automatically approved.  A stud ent who wants to take a course not listed \nmust obtain approval of the Director prior to  registering.  In general, the Director will \napprove any graduate SCS course of not more than  12 units.  It is also possible to seek \napproval for courses in other Colleges at  CMU.  However, those courses must be \nrationally related to an AI career in order to be approved as electives.  \n11-636 MSAII Independent Study (may be tak en ONCE as an electi ve unless permission \nof the Director is obtained) \n11-641 Machine Learning for Text Mining \n11-642 Search Engines 11-676 Big Data Analytics 11-747 Neural Networks for NLP \n11-755 Machine Learning for Signal Processing \n11-777 Advanced Multimodal Machine Learning 11-791 Design of Intelligent Information Systems 10-605 Machine Learning with Large Datasets 10-608 Conversational Machine Learning \n10-702 Statistical Machine Learning \n15-624 Foundations of Cyber-Physical Systems 15-645 Database Systems 15-681 AI: Representation and Problem Solving \n15-688 Practical Data Science \n16-720 Computer Vision 16-725 Medical Image Analysis 16-772 Sensing and Sensors 16-824 Visual Learning and Recognition \n17-637 Web Application Development \n17-639 Management of Software Development 17-652 Methods: Deciding What to Design 17-653 Managing Software Development \n17-766 Software Engineering for Startups ", "16 \n\u00a002-604 Fundamentals of Bioinformatics \n02-718 Computational Medicine  \nIndependent study (11-636) is encouraged.  The process is that you find a faculty \nmember willing to supervise your independent study,  assign a number of credits not to \nexceed 12, and assign a grade at the end of the study.  Th e faculty member must send \nan email to the Director indicating such wi llingness.  You can then register for 11-636. \n \nCourses carrying more than 12 units in a se mester are NOT APPROVED as electives.  \n Students may take athletics or music or th eatrical performance courses that do not \nrequire work outside of class times.  Ho wever, such courses will NOT count toward \nthe 195 units required for graduation. \n10.2.1  Incomplete Grades  \nCarnegie Mellon University students are expect ed to complete a course during the academic \nsemester in which the course was taken. Howeve r, if the instructor agrees, a grade of \u201cI\u201d \n(incomplete) may be given when a student has b een unable to complete the work of a course. \nHowever, the work completed up to that date must be of pa ssing quality and the grade of \nincomplete provides no undue advantage to that student over other students.  \nBy awarding an \u201cI\u201d grade, an instructor must spe cify the requirements for the completion of the \nwork and designate a default letter grade in th e event that the student fails to complete the \nremaining work.  \nStudents must complete the required course work  by no later than th e end of the following \nacademic semester or sooner if  required by the instructor.  \nThe instructor must record the permanent cours e grade by the last day of the examination \nperiod of the following semester , or the Registrar will automatica lly assign the default grade.  \nIf further work has not been completed after o ne semester and a default grade is rendered, the \ndefault grade will become the grade of record. \n10.2.2  Change of grades and missing grades  \nIf a grade has been assigned in error, it can be  changed to a different  permanent grade. The \nprocedure for changing a grade is as follows: \n\uf0b7 Discuss the matter with the course instructor;  provide evidence th at the grade issued was \nnot the grade earned. ", "17 \n\u00a0\uf0b7 If the instructor agrees, the student should contact the prog ram administrator to process \na Change of Grade Form in or der to correct the grade that was issued in error. Generally, \nthe instructor is the final authority for a course grade. \n\uf0b7 If a grade has not been assigned, please notify  the course instructor for the completion of \na Missing Grade Form. \n10.2.3  Transferring to another program  \nA student may withdraw from th e MSAII program at any time.  If any requirement for the \nMSAII degree has not been met, the degree will  not be awarded.  O ccasionally, students are \naccepted into a different degree pr ogram at CMU and transfer to that program.  International \nstudents who do this should ch eck with OIE to ensure that th eir visa is not jeopardized. \n10.2.4  Intellectual Property Policy \nSee http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/IntellProp.html . \n10.2.5  Teaching Requirements \nNone.  Students who wish to do  so may apply for teaching assist ant positions for courses in \nwhich they have excelled.  It is important to ensure that the student\u2019s academic responsibilities \nare not adversely impacted by a TAship, and vice-versa. \n10.3 Advising   \n10.3.1  Student Advising  \nEvery MSAII student will be assigned an advisor,  normally the Program Director.  Before the \ncourse registration period each semester, students  must meet with their advisor to discuss their \ncourse selection. New students wi ll be given instructions to regist er for their classes during the \nsummer prior to entrance.    \n10.3.2  Monitoring Progress  \nThe advisor meets with the student at least twic e a year, providing guidance and monitoring the \nstudent\u2019s overall progress.   \n10.3.3  Degree Certification  \nStudents who graduate having met all the requ irements for the degree will receive a diploma \nstating that they have received a \u201cMaster of Science in Artifici al Intelligence and Innovation.\u201d ", "18 \n\u00a010.4 Internship   \nStudents must obtain an internship during the summer between the first and second years of the \nprogram.  This is a requirement.  An internship will provide stu dents with the opportunity to \napply the knowledge and technical skills learned d uring the first year of the program, to gain \ninsight into AI and future marke t needs to further their experienc e and develop a strong context \nfor the second-year concentration coursework.  No rmally the internship wi ll be with an outside \ncompany.  In some circumstances, a student wh o is doing research with  a CMU faculty member \nduring the summer may request that such  research qualify as an internship. \nThe internship must involve at le ast two months of full-time work  and must relate to computer \nsoftware development and is preferably AI-related. \nStudents are encouraged to intern with an organiza tion that corresponds to their individual area \nof interest and career goals.   \nAll students who secure summer internships must register for three units in 11-935 (LTI \nPracticum).  This course can be taken once du ring the program with Pass/Fail and will be \ncounted toward graduation units.  Internationa l students must apply for Curricular Practical \nTraining (CPT) for the internship by contacting the Office of International Education (OIE).  To \nobtain CPT, students need an offer letter spelling  out employment dates, work hours, and wages \nor stipend.  It is the student\u2019s responsibility in 11-935 to give a presentation during the semester \nfollowing the internship to a ll current MSAII students detailing the student\u2019s internship \nexperience. \nInternational students who are in terested in working in  the U.S after graduation are required to \nconsult with the Office of International Educat ion (OIE) which oversees the OPT registration.  \nNote: OPT must only be used after students have completed their degree at Carnegie Mellon. \u00a0\nNOTE : Students are personally respon sible for securing a suitable internship.  The Career and \nProfessional Development Center will assist in their search for counseling, workshops, and \ninternship opportunity listings in Handshake .  We strongly suggest students begin the \ninternship search beginnin g in the Fall of your first year. So me internship opportunities have \napplication deadlines in the Fall,  so by starting your search ea rly, you won't miss out on these \ninternships.  The Career and Pr ofessional Development Center will assist students with the \ninternship search, but does not match students with employers; obtaining an internship is the \nstudents\u2019 responsibility.   \nThe following steps are recommended to ensure a successful internship outcome.  Many of the \nevents below have been modified due to COVID. \nSeptember/October  \n\uf0b7 Meet with your advisor to discuss your in terests and plan your internship search.  ", "19 \n\u00a0\uf0b7 Review the internships of previous students. We also encourage you to speak informally \nwith second-year students who can offer firs t-hand information about their internships.  \n\uf0b7 Attend the Technical Opportunities Conferenc e (TOC) at Carnegie Mellon for exposure \nto potential employers for internships.   \nNovember/December  \n\uf0b7 Begin researching organizations and internsh ip opportunities. Pay close attention to \norganizations that have established inte rnship programs and their deadlines.  \n\uf0b7 Attend workshops to perfec t your resume, hone your inte rviewing skills, and gain \nknowledge about the intern ship search process.  \nJanuary/February  \n\uf0b7 At this point, you should have a \u201cshort list\u201d of organizations at which you would like to \nintern. This list can include organizations th at have established internship programs as \nwell as those that interest you without formal internship programs. \n\uf0b7 Update your resume with relevant ac ademic projects, coursework, etc. \n\uf0b7 Begin utilizing your network for internship leads as well as checking organization\u2019s \nwebsites for internships.  \n\uf0b7 Make contact with employers, sending resume s and applications, and initiating internship \ninterviews in person  or by phone.  \n\uf0b7 Attend Network Nights and talk to alumni  about internship opportunities in their \norganization. They are an excellent resourc e for learning more about a particular \norganization, career field or employment oppo rtunity. You can find alumni in the Alumni \nDirectory, Alumni Career Advisor Networ k, and Carnegie Mellon Alumni LinkedIn \nNetwork.  \nMarch/April  \n\uf0b7 At this point, you should ha ve secured an internship or be  interviewing with various \norganizations.  \n\uf0b7 Prepare a backup plan if your first ch oices of internships do not work out. \n\uf0b7 Attend relevant Network Nights and Career Fairs at Carnegie Mellon.  \n\uf0b7 If you are an F-1 Visa student, you must apply for CPT.  \n\uf0b7 MSAII students should enroll in 11-935 for three units. You will not have to pay tuition for \nthis course.   \n10.5 Employment Eligibility Verification  \nIf you are receiving compensation or a stipend from  CMU, if you are going to be a TA or you are \nplanning to seek a position with CMU, then Em ployment Eligibility Verification is required.  \nForm I-9 must be completed within 3 busine ss days of beginning work for any type of \ncompensation (stipend or employment). Addi tional details are highlighted below. ", "20 \n\u00a0To ensure compliance with federal law, Carnegie Mellon University maintains the Employment \nEligibility Verification (I-9) Policy [pdf]  covering the university\u2019s I- 9 and E-Verify requirements:  \nEvery individual receiving a stipend from CMU or  employed by CMU must comply with the I-9 \nPolicy by completing the Form I-9 within thre e business days following the first day of stipend \nstart date/employment.  \nIndividuals who expect to work  on a federally funded projec t are further responsible for \nsubmitting an E-Verify Processing Request Form to the Office of Human Resources.  \nFor more information, please see CMU\u2019s Guidance for Completing the Form I-9 and E-Verify \nRequirements at CMU [pdf] , or visit the Human Reso urces Service website to learn more about \nForm I-9 and E-Verify  and to schedule an appointment to  complete the Form I-9.  \n10.6 MSAII Orientation  \nEach Fall semester, the MSAII pr ogram provides a program orientation to help new students \nlearn about the program. All new students are re quired to attend them and treat them seriously \nbecause they explain the program sequence, it s Core and Knowledge co urses requirements and \nhow students will meet the program learning outcomes.  \n10.7 End of Semester Evaluation \nThe MSAII program conducts an academic progress re view at the conclusion of each semester in \norder to monitor individual student progress towa rds graduation. Should a student\u2019s effort fall \nbelow the acceptable level of academic perfor mance and/or fail to meet the standards \nestablished by the MSAII program, the stud ent may be dismissed from the program. \nAfter each academic progress revi ew, a student may receive one or  more letters, indicating the \nresult of the review. See Section 3.1, Co urse Grade and GPA Requirements, above. \nAt the end of the semester, the faculty evaluate s each student's academic progress. If a student \nseems to be having trouble, th e faculty determines whether it believes that the student can \nfinish the degree, and if  so, what needs to be accomplished to get back on track. This type of \nletter should be considered a serious warning. It is not a permanent \"black mark\" on the \nstudent's record; if the student begins making sa tisfactory progress again, there is no official \nrecord of the letter in the student's transcript. \nIn the most serious cases, the faculty gives the stud ent a letter that specifies a list of conditions \nthat the student must satisfy by specific deadlines . Failure to meet all of the specified conditions \nmay result in the student's te rmination from the program. ", "21 \n\u00a010.8 Enrollment Verification \nEnrollment Services is the only University office th at can provide an official letter of enrollment, \nofficial transcript, and enrollment verification.  Enrollment verification can be requested online \nthrough The HUB at www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/student-records/transcripts/ .  \n10.9 University Policies on Grades and Grading \n10.9.1  University Policy on Grades \nwww.cmu.edu/policies/student-an d-student-life/grading.html  \n \nThis policy offers details concerning university grading principles for students taking courses \nand covers the specifics of assigning and changi ng grades, grading options, drop/withdrawals, \nand course repeats.  It also defines the un dergraduate and graduate grading standards. \n10.9.2  University Policy on Grades for Transfer Courses & PCHE \nwww.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student -life/transfer-credit-evaluation-and-\nassignment.html   \nCarnegie Mellon University offers students the o pportunity to take courses for credit through a \ncross-registration program (see Pittsburgh Co uncil on Higher Education (PCHE) and Cross-\nregistration below) and through the receipt of tr ansfer credit from other accredited institutions. \nThe Carnegie Mellon University transcript will in clude information on such courses as follows: \nCarnegie Mellon courses and courses taken throug h the university's cross-registration program \nwill have grades recorded on the transcript and be factored into the QPA. All other courses will \nbe recorded on this transcript indicating where the course was taken but without a grade. Such \ncourses will not be taken into account for academic actions, honors  or QPA calculations. (Note: \nSuspended students may take courses elsewhere; ho wever, they may receive transfer credit only \nif their college\u2019s and department's policies allow this.)  \nThe MSAII program does not accept transfer credit for courses taken prior to matriculation at \nCarnegie Mellon. \nThe MSAII program does not accept  distance education credits except for distance courses \noffered by Carnegie Mello n or PCHE institutions. \n10.10 Academic Integrity \nCarnegie Mellon\u2019s Academic Integrity policy is posted at  \nhttps://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and -student-life/academic-integrity.html.  All students ", "22 \n\u00a0are expected to be familiar with this policy, including the university-wi de protocol for handling \nacademic integrity violations.  The policy incl udes the University expectations around academic \nintegrity and provides definitions of cheati ng, plagiarism, and unauthorized assistance.  \nA review of the University\u2019s Academ ic Disciplinary Actions procedures \n(https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/th eword/academic-discipline/index.html ) is also \nrecommended. These procedures outline the proc ess for investigating, reporting, and \nadjudicating violations of the University Policy  on Academic Integrit y. The procedures also \noutline the appeal process. \nIt is an absolute requirement  that the work you submit must be your own, unless you \nspecifically identify the source of any material th at is not yours.  This includes quotations and \nmaterial from websites.  In any written work (including presentations) you MUST list any \nperson other than yourself who assisted you in preparing that wo rk.  Any student who violates \nthe academic integrity policy will be subject to a University review that may result in \nsuspension or expulsion under University policies.  THE PROGRAM DIRECTOR, THE \nFACULTY AND THE UNIVERSITY ARE VERY SERIOUS ABOUT ENFORCEMENT OF THE \nACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY.   \nYou are not permitted to copy material from web pages, including Wikipedia, and present them \nas your own work.  Any copied material MUST appe ar in quotation marks or italics and MUST \nbe accompanied by a citation to the original source.   Failure to do this violates CMU\u2019s Policy on \nAcademic Integrity, which states, \u201cIn all academic work to be graded, the citation of all sources \nis required. \u2026 Plagiarism is defined as the use of work or concepts contributed by other \nindividuals without proper attribution or citation . Unique ideas or materia ls taken from another \nsource for either written or oral use must be  fully acknowledged in academic work to be \ngraded.\u201d \nIt is a violation of academic integrity for you to assist anyone else in violating the policy or to \nprovide your work to others to assist them.  Be cause team deliverables are the product of joint \nwork, it is the responsibility of each member of  a team to ensure that all team materials have \nbeen produced in conformance with CMU policies. Credit cannot be given fo r work that is not a \nstudent\u2019s own. Therefore, if one member of a team violates a policy, for example, by copying \nmaterial from the Internet without indicating it s source, then no one on the team can receive \ncredit for that work, even if only one studen t is directly guilty of violating the policy. \nWe are aware that acts that constitute cheating  can be viewed very di fferently in different \ncountries and cultures.  However, Carnegie Me llon is a U.S. university and its policies reflect \nU.S. culture.  Employers expect that students  who graduate from Carnegie Mellon have \nobtained their degree legitimately and according to Carnegie Mellon policies.  If you have any \ndoubt whether proposed conduct would be consi dered cheating under Carnegie Mellon policies, \nASK A FACULTY MEMBER OR THE DIRECTOR FIRST.   ", "23 \n\u00a0All violations of the Academic Integrity policy MUST be reported to the University \nadministration by the faculty members involved.  Copies go to the Program Director, the Head of \nthe Language Technology Institute, the Associate Dean for Master\u2019s Programs, and various \nofficials at Warner Hall.   The faculty do not ha ve the option to decli ne to make a report.  The \noffending student will receive an email to inform them of an A cademic Integrity Violation (AIV). \nThe email will specify the offense and the penalt y, and will inform the student of available \nappeal procedures. An AIV that is successfully appealed is erased. \nImportant note:   The university policy gives a depart ment the option of \u201cconven[ing] a \ndisciplinary hearing according to the procedure s of the department/pro gram.\u201d  The LTI has a \n\u201ctwo strikes\u201d rule.  The LTI may terminate a st udent for a first violation, depending upon the \ncircumstances and severity of the violation.  The LTI always terminates  a student for a second \nviolation, with no exceptions.  \n11 Academic Policies \n11.1 Course Registration    \n11.1.1 Status \nAll Students must be registered for at least 48 units during each semest er. Any questions about \nregistration should be directed  to the Enrollment Serv ices (the HUB). Note that International \nstudents are required to be re gistered as full-time students, minimum 36 units .   \n11.1.2 Academic Calendar  \nThe Academic Calendar can be found at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/calendar/ .   All dates about \nregistration, add/drop deadlines, university ho lidays and more can be  found there.    \n11.1.3 Online Registration  \nAll new students will register for required courses in Apri l after accepting admission and \nreceiving an Andrew ID. After that, students wi ll register following th e schedule set by the \nHUB. Note that students must meet with thei r advisor to obtain approval for their course \nselection. Registration information is available at \nwww.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/registration/index.html .  Online registration is done with an \nAndrew ID at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/sio/about.html .   \nStudents must register for at le ast 48 units per semester.   ", "24 \n\u00a011.1.4 Double-Dipping \nAn MSAII student who applies courses taken as part of another degree program (at Carnegie \nMellon or elsewhere) toward their program requ irements cannot use those same courses toward \nany other M.S. degree offered by the School of Computer Science without prior approval. \n11.1.5 Pass/No Pass Courses (Pass/Fail) \nWith the approval of the Program Director , a graduate student may choose to take one \nELECTIVE course pass/no pass. Core courses an d Knowledge courses may not be taken pass/no \npass.  By the deadline for changing a course to  pass/no pass, the student must fill out the \nPass/No Pass Approval Form and receive permissio n from their advisor. A pass/no pass election \nis irrevocable as a matter of CMU policy. (A form can be found at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/forms.html ) \n11.1.6 Auditing a Course  \nWith the approval of the Program Director, a gr aduate student may audit a course by obtaining \nthe permission of the instructor or teaching department and completi ng the Course Audit \nApproval Form. Audited classes are not taken for credit and cannot be used to fulfill graduation \nrequirements. (Audit form can be found at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/forms.html )  \n11.1.7 Adding a Course  \nDuring the ADD period of each se mester (the first two weeks of the semester), students may add \na course by registering online. After the ADD dead line, they may add a course by completing the \nLate Add Request form and obta ining the permission of both: 1) the instructor or teaching \ndepartment and 2) their advisor.  (Add form can be found at \nhttps://www.cmu.edu/hub/forms.html )   \n11.1.8 Dropping a Course  \nDropping courses is not recommended except for reas ons of health or fami ly emergency.  Many \nSCS courses have long waitlist s, and dropping a course means that some other student who \nmight have had the opportunity to take the course had been denied that ability.  Also, if students \nin the MSAII program drop courses, then the inst ructors of those courses may no longer allow \nMSAIIs to enroll. \nSometimes, however, a student\u2019s workload can  become unexpectedly heavy because of course \nrequirements.  No one is expected to suffer from such pressure a nd dropping a course may \nbecome a necessity.  To avoid this unfortunate circumstance, yo u should inform yourself in \nadvance of the curriculum and workload in each co urse you plan to take and ensure that you are \ncapable of handling the load.  Note that CMU SCS courses are very di fficult, and students who ", "25 \n\u00a0may easily have handled taking five courses sim ultaneously at another institution may not be \nable to do so at CMU. \nExact add, drop and withdrawal dates may be fou nd on the official Academic Calendar. Up until \nthe deadlines, students can initiate course adds and drops through Student Information Online \n(SIO). Courses dropped by the deadline will not appear on the student's record, and courses \nwithdrawn from by the deadline will receive a 'W ' grade. Additionally, a voucher process has \nbeen implemented for late drops. \nStudents taking undergraduate and Master\u2019s level courses must follow the procedures and \ndeadlines for adding, dropping, or withdrawing from courses as identified on the academic \ncalendar. Information can be found at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/course-\nchanges/index.html . \nLate Course Drops & Vouchers \nA late drop voucher system was implemented begi nning with the fall 2018 semester to permit a \nlimited number of late course drops. Master's st udents are permitted one drop voucher per year \nof study and may use only one voucher per se mester (including summer).  Courses dropped \nusing a voucher will be removed from the student' s record, as long as the drop is confirmed in \nSIO by the student within 24 hours of rece iving the automated voucher email (refer to \ninstructions below). Students may use drop vouche rs up until the last day of classes each \nsemester.  These policies are spelled out at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/course-\nchanges/index.html . \nNote that the Core courses and some Knowledg e courses are only offe red once per year so \ndropping a course may delay program completion.  \nNote:  International students must maintain a minimu m of 36 units (Full time) to meet the U.S. \ngovernment\u2019s visa requirement. Please check with  the Office of International Education (OIE) \nfor more information.   \n11.1.9 Transfer Credits  \nhttps://www.cmu.edu/policies/st udent-and-student-life/trans fer-credit-evaluation-and- \nassignment.html \nCarnegie Mellon University offers students the o pportunity to take courses for credit through a \ncross-registration program (see Pittsburgh Co uncil on Higher Education (PCHE) and Cross-\nregistration below) and through the receipt of tr ansfer credit from other accredited institutions. \nThe Carnegie Mellon University transcript will in clude information on such courses as follows: \nCarnegie Mellon courses and courses taken throug h the university's cross-registration program \nwill have grades recorded on the transcript and be factored into the QPA. All other courses will \nbe recorded on this transcript indicating where the course was taken, but without grades. Such ", "26 \n\u00a0courses will not be taken into account for academic actions, honors  or QPA calculations. (Note: \nsuspended students may take courses elsewhere; ho wever, they may receive transfer credit only \nif their college's and department's policies allow this.). \nThe MSAII program does not accept transfer credits. \n11.1.10  Leave of Absence  \nStudents who need to delay their studies for pers onal, medical or academic reasons may do so \nwith a leave of absence (leaving the universit y temporarily with a co mmitment to return). \nStudents must contact the MSAII Director to discuss their plans and fill out the appropriate form.  The student\u2019s place in the program will be  held until a mutually  determined time. For \nmore information refer to www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/student-leave.html . \nWhen planning to return from Leave of Abs ence students must complete the appropriate \npaperwork before returnin g to the University.   \nMSAII students who require longer than the standard time to complete their degree \nrequirements are expected to remain in close contact  with the program, and will be certified at \nthe end of the semester in which they have co mpleted their degree requirements. Students must \nrefer to the CMU Policy on Master \u2019s Student Statute of Limitations \n(https://www.cmu.edu/policies/ student-and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of-\nlimitations.html ) regarding guidelines and restrictions  which place an upper limit on the \nmaximum length of time allowable for maste r\u2019s degree completion and certification. \n11.1.11  Additional Guidance for Students   \nProgram of study . Students seeking guidance about their program of study and degree \nrequirements should consult with their academic  advisor and/or appropriate associate dean.  \nFinancial aid and student account.  Students are expected to make normal progress toward \ntheir degree in order to graduate within the st andard timeframe for their program of study. \nUnder U.S. Federal Title IV regulations, student eligibility for federal financial aid is contingent \nupon enrollment in and successful completion of courses that are counted as credit toward their \ncurrent degree program. To receive the maximum amount of federal financial aid for which they \nmay be eligible, students must enroll each semester  in at least 36 units that count toward their \ncurrent degree level. (See separate guidance  regarding integrated degree completion.)  \nStudents should consult with their designated co llege liaison in The HU B regarding billing and \nfinancial aid, particularly for early completion , longer-than-standard completion, or integrated \nundergraduate and master\u2019s degree programs.  \nInternational students . Immigration status for students in  F-1 and J-1 non-immigrant status is \ntied to making normal progress toward completing  degree requirements. Therefore, F-1 and J-1 ", "27 \n\u00a0students who are considering completing their de gree requirements early, anticipating longer-\nthan-standard completion, or moving from an un dergraduate to a graduate student classification \n(integrated undergraduate-graduate study) should  consult with their designated advisor in the \nOffice of International Education (OIE) to ens ure compliance with immigration regulations. \n11.1.12  Withdrawal   \nStudents who need to withdraw from the program (leave the university with no intention of \nreturning) for personal, medical or academic reasons must contact the MSAII Director to \ndiscuss their plans and fill out the appropri ate form. For more information refer to \nwww.cmu.edu/policies/student-and- student-life/student-leave.html .    \n11.2 Tuition and Fees   \nInformation about tuition and fees is available at https://www.cmu.edu/sfs/tuition/index.html .  \nMSAII students will pay tuition according to the ra tes set for the School of Computer Science.  \nAll tuition and fees must be paid in full by the due date; a student not in good financial standing \nwill be dismissed from the program. Students ta king summer courses must pay tuition.   \n11.3 Graduation Ceremonies   \nThe University holds one Commencement ceremony in May of each year.  Only students who \nhave completed their degree requirem ents may participate in Commencement. \nThere are no August or December commencement ceremonies.  \n11.3.1 Withdrawal of Degree \nA degree once conferred can be withdrawn by the University under certain circumstances.  See \nthe Withdrawal of Degree Policy . \n11.4 LTI Academic Policies \n11.4.1 \u201cGrandfather\u201d policy \nA student can graduate under the policies in effect at the time that the student entered the \nprogram; or, at the student's choice, the student  can graduate under policies that are adopted \nafter the student entered the program. If it is no t realistic to follow a particular policy exactly, \nthe department may approximate the policy as closely as possible; this situation is rare and \ntypically arises only when a student is enrolled in the program for an extended period. ", "28 \n\u00a011.4.2  Definition of transfer credit  versus course exemption  \nThe LTI may grant transfer credit  or issue an exemption  for equivalent graduate courses \npreviously completed at another institution. This decision rests with the program director, on \nthe advice of the faculty memb er for whose course an exempt ion is sought. If a student is \nexempt  from a required course due to  prior courses or experience, the student can replace that \ncourse with an open elective. The student does  not receive credit for the exempted course but \ncan take any course that could normally count toward the degree in its place. If a student \nreceives credit  for prior coursework completed at Car negie Mellon or elsewhere, the student \nreceives that many units of credit and the to tal amount of required coursework is reduced by \nthat amount. \n11.4.3  Employment/Consulting \nSince consulting provides useful experience, stu dents are generally permitted to consult at most \none day per seven-day week, with the Program Di rector's consent.  International students must \nalso have approval in advance from the Office  of International Educat ion (OIE) for any paid \nposition.  Students may use their consulting time to perform unpa id work on research projects \nfor CMU faculty for up to 10 hours per week. \nStudents may serve as teaching assistants for CMU faculty.   TA work is inconsistent with \nresearch because of the necessary time commitm ent.  Students must choose one activity or the \nother, not both. \nNote that there is an English language proficienc y requirement for TAs.  Graduate students are \nrequired to have a certain level of  fluency in English before they can instruct in Pennsylvania, as \nrequired by the English Fluency in Higher Ed ucation Act of 1990. Through this Act, all \ninstitutions of higher educatio n in the state are required to ev aluate and certify the English \nfluency of all instructional personnel, includ ing teaching assistants and interns. The full \nuniversity policy can be reviewed at: https://www.cmu.edu/polic ies/faculty/evaluation-\ncertification-english-fluency-instructors.html . \n11.4.4  Leave of Absence \nThe LTI discourages Leaves of Absence (LOA) since students usually do not return, despite \nhaving good intentions. However,  a student in good standing may  be granted a LOA of at most \none year, upon written request to the MSAII Dire ctor and with the consent of the student's \nadvisor. It is the responsibility of  the student on LOA to contact th e LTI to initiate a return to \nthe program. \nStudents taking or returning from a leave of absence must follow the university\u2019s leave of \nabsence process, which is described at www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-\nlife/student-leave.html.  ", "29 \n\u00a011.4.5  Satisfactory Progress \nIf a student  does not make satisfactory progress each se mester toward completing the degree, the \nLTI may remove the student from the program.  See section on \u201cEnd of Semester Evaluation.\u201d \n11.5 Carnegie Mellon Academic Policies \n11.5.1 Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities \nThe Office of Disability Resources at Carneg ie Mellon University has a continued mission to \nprovide physical and programmatic campus access to all events and information within the \nCarnegie Mellon community.  We work to ensure that qualified individuals receive reasonable \naccommodations as guaranteed by the Americans wi th Disabilities Act (ADA) and Sections 503 \nand 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  St udents who would like to receive accommodations \nmust submit a Voluntary Disclosure of Disability Form  to access@andrew.cmu.edu  to begin the \ninteractive accommodation process.   \nFor more information, please see https://www.cmu.edu/disability-resources/ .Students with \nphysical, sensory, cognitive, or  emotional disabilities are enco uraged to self-identify with the \nOffice of Disability Resources  and request needed accommodation s.  Any questions about the \nprocess can be directed to access@andr ew.cmu.edu, or call (412) 268-6121. \n11.5.2  Summary of Graduate Student A ppeal and Grievance Procedures \nStudents who believe that they ha ve been inappropriately treated are encouraged to raise their \nconcern(s) with the Program Director, department  head, or other designa ted person in their \ndepartment, college, or central administration accord ing to University policies.  No effort will be \nmade to prevent or discourage anyone from availing themselves of such procedures (see Graduate Student Appeal and Procedures www.cmu.edu/graduate/poli cies/appeal-grievance-\nprocedures.html ). \nGraduate students will find the Summary of  Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance \nProcedures on the Graduate Education Reso urce web page.   This document summarizes \nprocesses available to graduate students who se ek review of academic and non-academic issues. \nGraduate students are expected to seek informal resolution of all concerns within the applicable \ndepartment, unit or program before invoking fo rmal processes. When an informal resolution \ncannot be reached, however, a gr aduate student who seeks furthe r review of the matter is to \nfollow the formal procedures outlined here.   Th ese appeal and grievanc e procedures shall apply \nto students in all graduate programs of the Univ ersity. Students should refer to the department \nspecific information in this handbook for dep artment and college information about the \nadministration and academic policies of the prog ram.  Additionally, students may confer with ", "30 \n\u00a0the Graduate Education Office ( grad-ed@cmu.edu ) on issues of process or other concerns as \nthey navigate conflicts. \n11.5.3  Process for Appealing Final Grades \nhttps://www.cmu.edu/graduate/policies /appeal-grievance-procedures.html .  \nFinal grades will be changed only in exceptiona l circumstances and only with the approval of \nthe instructor and the department, unit or prog ram. Grading is a matter of  sound discretion of \nthe instructor and final grades are rarely ch anged without the consent of the instructor who \nassigned the grade.  The following circumstances are the unusual exceptions that may warrant a \ngrade appeal: (a) the final grade assigned for a cours e is based on manifest error (e.g. a clear error \nsuch as arithmetic error in computing a grade or failure to grade one of the answers on an exam), \nor (b) the faculty or staff member who assigned the grade did so in violation of a University \npolicy \n11.5.4  Safeguarding Educational Equity: \nPolicy Against Sexual Harassment and Sexual Assault \nThe University prohibits sex-based discriminati on, sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating/ \ndomestic violence and stalking.

This policy addresses the circumstances in \nwhich romantic, sexual or amorous relationships/ interactions with undergraduate students, \neven if consensual, are inappropriate and prohib ited. The purpose of this policy is to assure \nhealthy professional relationships. This policy is not intended to discoura ge consensual intimate \nrelationships unless there is a conflicting profe ssional relationship in  which one party has \nauthority over the other as in the policy. \n11.5.5  Cultural Tolerance \nThe MSAII program is extremely diverse for a pr ogram of its size. We have students from \nnumerous different countries who must work effectively in a team se tting.  The students \ninvariably come from very different cultures that  have differing attitudes  towards age, gender, \nand group interaction.  The program management understands this, but th e students must also \nrecognize that this program is being conducted in  the United States and operates according to \nU.S. norms.  Students and faculty,  regardless of background, age, or rank, must deal with each \nother respectfully without insult or raised voices .  It is impossible to conduct teamwork in any \nother way.  Violations will be dealt with harshly.  The Program Director is not sympathetic to \nsuch behavior, which will not be tolerated.  Re peated infractions, or a serious single infraction \nmay result in termination from the program. \n11.5.6  Language Policy \nThe MSAII program is a component of the Language  Technologies Institute, which studies and \ncelebrates the diversity of human language and fo rms of expression.  The LTI also recognizes the \nfutility and unfairness of attempting to det ermine the language students must use when \ncommunicating.  However, it is unprofessional in any official team meeting to speak a language ", "32 \n\u00a0that is not understood by all team members.  Fo r example, if all members of a team understand \nChinese, then they may use Chi nese in team meetings.  However,  if even one team member does \nnot understand Chinese, then a language must be us ed that is understood by all team members.  \nIt is recommended that non-native speakers of Eng lish use English as much as possible if they \nintend to seek employment in  an English-speaking country. \n11.5.7  Childbirth/Maternity Accommodation Protocol \nThe Maternity Policy is available at https://www.cmu.edu/graduate/programs-\nservices/maternity-accommodation-protocol.html . \nStudents whose anticipated delivery date is duri ng the course of the semester may consider \ntaking time away from their coursework and re search responsibilities. All female students who \ngive birth to a child while engaged in coursework or  research are eligible to take either a short-\nterm absence or formal leave of absence. St udents in course work should consider either \nworking with their course instructor to receive in complete grades or elect to drop to part-time \nstatus or to take a semester leave of absence.   Students engaged in research must work with \ntheir faculty to develop plans for the re search for the time  they are away.  \n\u25cf Students must contact the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs to register for Maternity \nAccommodations. Students will complete an info rmation form and meet with a member of the \nDean\u2019s Office staff to determine resources and procedures appropriate for the individual student. \n\u25cb Planning for the student\u2019s discussio n with appropriate academic contact(s) \n(advisor, associate dean, etc.) may be reviewed during this meeting. \n\u25cf Students in course work should consider op tions for the semester of the anticipated \nbirth such as working with their course instructo rs to receive incomplete grades, electing to \ndrop to part-time status or taking  a full semester leave of absence. \n\u25cf Students engaged in research  must work with their facu lty to develop plans for the \nresearch for the time they are aw ay and for resuming upon return. \n\u25cf Master's students who receive an academ ic stipend funded by Carnegie Mellon are \neligible to continue to receive stipend funding for up to six (6) week s during a Short-Term \nMaternity Accommodation or a Formal Leave of Absence. Continued academic stipend funding may be extended by two (2) weeks, for a total of eight (8) weeks, if an absence longer than six \nweeks is medically necessary. To receive this supp ort students must be registered with the \nOffice of the Dean of Students. \nStudents are encouraged to consult with relevant university facu lty and staff as soon as possible \nas they begin making plans regarding time away.   Students must contact the Office of the Dean \nof Student Affairs to register for Maternity Accommodations.  Students will complete an \ninformation form and meet with a member of De an\u2019s Office staff to determine resources and ", "33 \n\u00a0procedures appropriate for the i ndividual student. Planning fo r the student\u2019s discussion with \nher academic contact(s) (advisor, associate dean, etc.) will be reviewed during this meeting. \n11.6 Statute of Limitations \nAs outlined in the Master\u2019s Students Statute of Limitations, www.cmu.edu/policies/student-\nand-student-life/masters-students-statute-of-limitations.html , students must complete all \nrequirements for the master\u2019s degree within  a maximum of seven years from original \nmatriculation as a master\u2019s student, or less if re quired by a more restrictive department, school \nor college policy.  Once this time-to-degree li mit has lapsed, the person may resume work \ntowards a master\u2019s degree only if newly admitted  to a currently offered master\u2019s degree program \nunder criteria determined by that program. \nUnder extraordinary circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, family or \nparental leave, or temporary disability, a school or college may, upon the relevant department's \nrecommendation and with the written approval of the dean (or designate), defer the lapse for a \nperiod commensurate with the duration of that  interruption. Students who are pursuing a \nmaster\u2019s degree as part-time students for all seme sters of their program,  as approved by their \nprogram, may also appeal to their program or department for extension of the time to degree \nlimit.  \nAny request for a waiver of the statute of limita tions must be approved by  the Department Head \nand by the SCS Associate Dean for Masters Programs. The waiver request must explain the \nexceptional circumstances that wa rrant an extension. For cases in which a waiver is granted, \nthe waiver will cover specific courses and will specify a time period for completion of the \nprogram. \nSee also the \u2018Duration of Study\u2019 policy. \n11.7 Residency Requirement \nThe MSAII is a full-time, in-resid ence program conducted only on the Pittsburgh campus.  In \nexceptional circumstances, such as visa compli cations or medical exigencies, permission may be \ngranted by the Director allowing a student to participate in short portions of the program \nremotely.  This is not possible for first-year students. \n12 Financial Issues \n12.1 Graduate Student Funding  ", "34 \n\u00a0The LTI does not provide financial aid or support to students in the professional MS programs.  \nStudents are encouraged to seek financial aid and s upport from other sources.
