["Tartan Facts: Who founded Carnegie Mellon University? Carnegie Technical Schools was founded in 1900 by Andrew Carnegie. Twelve years later it became known as the Carnegie Institute of Technology. In 1967, the school merged with Mellon Institute and became what is known today as Carnegie Mellon University. What is a Tartan? The Carnegie Mellon athletic teams are nicknamed the \"Tartans\" as a nod to Andrew Carnegie's Scottish heritage. A tartan is often misrepresented as a fierce warrior from either the Asian tundra or Scottish highlands. In actuality, a Tartan is a twilled woolen fabric with a plaid design. It is of Scottish origin and consists of stripes of various colors and widths against a solid ground, denoting a particular family lineage. The school's founder, Andrew Carnegie, was born in Dunfermline, Scotland, in 1835. Carnegie came to the United States in 1848 and founded Carnegie Technical Schools in Pittsburgh in 1900.\n\nThe Scottish terrier mascot performer sports Carnegie tartan attire, while the graphic mascot is wearing a plaid scarf around its neck. So what's the difference between tartan and plaid?\n\nYou'll know it's a tartan if...\u2022 \"It's a check or pattern in a variety of colours in woven fabric in which bands of colour are repeated in equal proportion in warp (running lengthwise) and weft (running across).\"\n\u2022 \"Each stripe of the warp crosses every stripe of the weft, so when vertical and horizontal stripes of the same color cross, the result is solid color at the point of intersection.\"\n\u2022 \"The arrangement of colored threads is the same in the warp as in the weft.\"\n\nYou can find our official tartan on various items in the University Store.\n\nSource: \"Tartan: Romancing the Plaid,\" by Jeffrey Banks and Doria De La Chapelle \n\n \n\nOfficial Mascot?\nMore than a century after Carnegie Mellon University opened its doors, an official mascot finally made its mark. Although students have dressed as a Scottish terrier \u2014 typically referred to as Scotty \u2014 for 50 years, it wasn't until 2007 that Carnegie Mellon officially welcomed the Scottish terrier as the university's first mascot.\n\nIn keeping with tradition, students, faculty, staff and alumni voted to name the new official mascot Scotty. But it's not just the costumed mascot that voters named. The live dog is also known as Scotty to the Carnegie Mellon community.\n\nAbout Scotty | Celebrating Scotty | Performer Requests\n\n \n\nDepartment Quick Facts\n\nName of School: Carnegie Mellon University\n\nCity/Zip: Pittsburgh, PA 15213\n\nFounded: 1900\n\nEnrollment (undergrad): 6,982- Fall 2021\n\nEnrollment (graduate and doctoral): 7,062 - Fall 2021\n\nAlumni: 102,577\n\nNickname: Tartans\n\nMascot: Scottie Dog\n\nSchool Colors: Cardinal and Gray\n\nFootball Stadium and Track and Field: Gesling Stadium\n\nCapacity: 3,500\n\nSurface: FieldTurf\n\nBasketball/Volleyball Gym: Wiegand Gymnasium\n\nCapacity: 500\n\nSoccer Stadium: CMU Soccer Field\n\nCapacity: 250 Surface: FieldTurf Affiliation: NCAA Division III Conference: University Athletic Association | Presidents' Athletic Conference (Football Only) President: Dr. Farnam Jahanian Alma Mater, Year: University of Texas at Austin Athletic Director: Dr. Josh Centor Alma Mater, Year: Brandeis, 2004 Athletic Department Phone: 412-268-8054 Mailing Address:  5000 Forbes Avenue / Pittsburgh, PA 15213\n"]
